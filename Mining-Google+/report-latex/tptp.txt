The TPTP (Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers) is a library of problems, in classical logic with an interpreted equality symbol, for Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) systems. The TPTP contains problems in typed higher-order form (THF) - simply typed lambda calculus, typed first-order form (TFF) - monomorphic typed first-order logic with predefined numeric types, first-order form (FOF) - classical first-order logic with quantifiers, and clause normal form (CNF) - first-order logic in conjunctive clausal form
