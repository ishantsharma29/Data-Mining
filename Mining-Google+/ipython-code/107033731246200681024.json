   "content": "\"Surely Democrats and Republicans could agree to cut billions from a failed program like this!\" you think. What their failure to do so says something about politics, but I think it also speaks to the failed regulatory model that we use to manage programs like this. \u00a0From the article: \u00a0\"Consider the Education Management Corporation, which runs 110 schools in the United States for chefs, artists and other trades. It has been investigated or sued in recent years by prosecutors in at least 12 states. The Justice Department has accused the company of illegally using incentives to pay its recruiters. And last year, investors filed a class-action lawsuit, contending that the company engaged in deceptive enrollment practices and manipulated federal student loan and grant programs.\u00a0Education Management nonetheless received more than $1.25 billion in federal money over the last school year....\"The continuing flow of money illustrates the quandary facing federal education officials. On one hand, they have moved forcefully to try to protect taxpayer funds and prevent students from falling deeply into debt without anything to show for it. On the other, they must avoid running roughshod over private for-profit schools that have not been found guilty of wrongdoing. Agency officials point out that they cannot withhold money based on accusations, but must have proof of misconduct.\"The fundamental notion that you can only regulate by punishing wrongdoing is at the heart of the failure. Good regulatory systems are management systems, that keep a system operating smoothly.A plane's autopilot does not kick in after the plane has crashed. It is designed to keep it from crashing. Credit card fraud detection software doesn't wait till you've gone bankrupt from fraudulent charges to intervene and stop further transactions. Google search quality doesn't reserve space in the top spots for spammers lest it hurt their business!These practical and commercial regulatory regimes should be a model for how we think about government regulation as well.I've written about this topic at greater length in my article Open Data and Algorithmic Regulation: \u00a0http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-5/open-data-and-algorithmic-regulation/\ufeff",

I have always loved Wallace Stevens' thoughts in Esthetique du Mal in moments like this:\"He breathes a summer sleep,In which his wound is good because life was.No part of him was ever part of death.\"And yes, there is somehow a deep continuity, in which we all one way or another come to that moment of our undoing, and our end is just one more part of a good life. None of us know when it will be. So we have to make the most of each moment - and that's what Jake did, throwing himself into life, fully.But it's still a tragedy. Edna St Vincent Millay captured that tragedy perfectly in Dirge without Music:\"I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. CrownedWith lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,A formula, a phrase remains,\u2014but the best is lost.The answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,\u2014They are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curledIs the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve.More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.Down, down, down into the darkness of the graveGently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.\"\ufeff",

While the speaker list is still preliminary, it tells the story of what we're going after. Explore the speaker pages - I've loaded them with quotes from the speakers, which will help you understand in advance where they are coming from. Over the next few weeks and months, we'll be curating an online conversation, with lots of great reading and viewing, to engage with these ideas, whether or not you are coming to the event.\ufeff",

Why do US taxpayers still pay hundreds of millions of dollars for websites that should cost thousands (and often don\u2019t work)? The real reasons may surprise you. For government to work in the 21st century, it must become competent \u2013 even great \u2013 at digital. The bad news is that no one is going to do that for us.

   "content": "Absolutely fascinating exploration of the microbiome of a city.For those who don't know what the microbiome is, the article defines it with some interesting statistics:\"Typically, every person is home to about a hundred trillion microbial cells bearing five million different genes, totaling about 5 pounds of micro-organisms per person. Indeed, microbes in and on the body outnumber human cells about 10 to one.\u201cYou are a minority party in the democracy of the body,\u201d Dr. Mason said.\"The body\u2019s collection of microbes, called the microbiome, influences health in ways that researchers are only beginning to understand. They may be key to proper digestion, vitamin synthesis and brain function, new research suggests. Changes among the millions of microbes living in the human stomach also may promote obesity, trigger ulcers or affect how well a flu vaccine works.\"The article describes a research project to explore signs of this microbiome expressed on surfaces throughout the NYC subways.My two favorite quotes:\u201cA city is like an organism,\u201d said IBM Corp. computational biologist Robert Prill, who is among those at the company investigating ways to better collect and analyze these immense new public-health genome databases. \u201cIt has a circulating system consisting of the movement of people.\u201dand\u201cWe know next to nothing about the ecology of urban environments,\u201d said evolutionary biologist Jonathan Eisen at the University of California at Davis. \u201cHow will we know if there is something abnormal if we don\u2019t know what normal is?\u201d\ufeff",

   "content": "This was my favorite piece in this Sunday's New York Times. It's a fascinating article about CBW, a tiny bank in Kansas, that has become a laboratory for financial innovation with a focus on better user experience.\"The creation of the new bank, and the maintenance of the old one, are the work of a couple who were born in India and ended up in Kansas after living in Silicon Valley and passing through jobs at Google and Lehman Brothers....\"Their work is an unusual experiment: a new kind of mom-and-pop business trying to reshape a highly regulated and innovation-resistant industry. The new services that CBW is providing, like instant payments to any bank in the United States, direct remittance transfers abroad and specialized debit cards, might seem as if they should be painless upgrades in an age of high-frequency trading and interplanetary space missions. But with most banks, it still takes longer to send money to another country or even to another state than it does to travel the same distance.\"I was particularly struck by this paragraph, which reminded me of the fundamental game plan that we practice on government with the Code for America Fellowship:\"As he and his wife had hoped, buying an established institution allowed them to examine how money transfers and payment technology worked in a traditional bank \u2014 something that was hard to see in detail from the outside \u2014 and to consider how to make changes.\"His first discovery was that nearly all banks rely on a few big, and not terribly agile, outside vendors to provide all the software that makes bank computer systems work. Mr. Ramamurthi found a small technology provider that would be more flexible and allow him to begin tweaking the software....\"Get inside, figure out how it works now. Then start to iterate towards change, making the institution more flexible, and able to meet real user needs.\ufeff",

If it were consistent with the Obama open data guidance, that RFP would require an API so that independent companies could provide alternate interfaces, just like travel sites provide booking interfaces for air travel, hotels, and more.\u00a0Unfortunately, as drafted, the RFP allows the winning contractor to determine whether an API is feasible \u2014 meaning the company that benefits most from keeping all the reservations to itself \u00a0has the authority to do so. And the draft even removes data that is currently accessible \u2014 availability data \u2014 from public sharing. So, it\u2019s a huge step backward, and completely out of step with the administration\u2019s open data policy.The founder of Hipcamp, Alyssa Ravasio, has written up some thoughts on how this RFP could be improved that I want to share with you. And after reading them, I\u2019m hoping you will be moved to send comments asking the Department of the Interior to reconsider their RFP.Comments on this draft are accepted via email to jasonmking@fs.fed.us through Wednesday October 22. Please send your comments.\ufeff",

   "content": "Can We Use Data to Make Better Regulations?Evgeny Morozov either misunderstands or misrepresents the key point of my piece on Algorithmic Regulation. \u00a0In his recent New Yorker article about big data and regulation, he summarizes my view as \"collect as much relevant data from as many sources as possible, analyze them in real time, and make an optimal decision based on the current circumstances rather than on some idealized projection.\"In fact, my article is about building regulations that do a better job of achieving their \u00a0long term idealized outcome! \u00a0Morozov has \u00a0got it precisely backwards.Here's what I actually said on the subject. \u00a0The article opens:\"Regulation is the bugaboo of today\u2019s politics. We have too much of it in most areas, we have too little of it in others, but mostly, we just have the wrong kind, a mountain of paper rules, inefficient processes, and little ability to adjust the rules or the processes when we discover the inevitable unintended results.\"Consider, for a moment, regulation in a broader context. Your car\u2019s electronics regulate the fuel-air mix in the engine to find an optimal balance of fuel efficiency and minimal emissions. An airplane\u2019s autopilot regulates the countless factors required to keep that plane aloft and heading in the right direction. Credit card companies monitor and regulate charges to detect fraud and keep you under your credit limit. Doctors regulate the dosage of the medicine they give us, sometimes loosely, sometimes with exquisite care, as with the chemotherapy required to kill cancer cells while keeping normal cells alive, or with the anesthesia that keeps us unconscious during surgery while keeping vital processes going. ISPs and corporate mail systems regulate the mail that reaches us, filtering out spam and malware to the best of their ability. Search engines regulate the results and advertisements they serve up to us, doing their best to give us more of what we want to see.\"What do all these forms of regulation have in common?\"A deep understanding of the desired outcome\"Real-time measurement to determine if that outcome is being achieved\"Algorithms (i.e. a set of rules) that make adjustments based on new data\"Periodic, deeper analysis of whether the algorithms themselves are correct and performing as expected.\"There are a few cases\u2014all too few\u2014in which governments and quasi-governmental agencies regulate using processes similar to those outlined above. Probably the best example is the way that central banks regulate the money supply in an attempt to manage interest rates, inflation, and the overall state of the economy. Surprisingly, while individual groups might prefer the US Federal Reserve to tighten or loosen the money supply at a different time or rate than they do, most accept the need for this kind of regulation.\"Why is this?\"The desired outcomes are clear\"There is regular measurement and reporting as to whether those outcomes are being achieved, based on data that is made public to everyone\"Adjustments are made when the desired outcomes are not being achieved\"Contrast this with the normal regulatory model, which focuses on the rules rather than the outcomes. How often have we faced rules that simply no longer make sense? How often do we see evidence that the rules are actually achieving the desired outcome?\"(http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-5/open-data-and-algorithmic-regulation/).\ufeff",

But so is the idea of a \"universal remote.\" So what will the platform be for interoperability in the smart home, smart car, and the smart body network? \u00a0We had a spirited debate on the O'Reilly Radar backchannel, which +Jon Bruner\u00a0and +Jenn Webb\u00a0 turned into a blog post, in which we handicap the various players.There was a lot of support for Apple as the winner; I argued for Google/Android.\u00a0I am a huge fan of Google Now. It seems to me to be the most interesting thing happening in Silicon Valley today. It is getting smarter by leaps and bounds, and is pointing us towards a whole new way of interacting with computers. \u00a0The combination of Google Now voice control with a smart watch running Google Wear has been truly transformative for the way I interact with applications and devices.What I'm waiting for is a better \"user programming model.\" \u00a0Google Now or Siri plus IFTTT. \u00a0Speech brings us back to the command line, and the Unix Shell was the most powerful command line I've used. I loved how it seduced people into programming. \u00a0Anything could be a command, and you could combine them into new \"scripts\" (sentences if you will), that then could become first class verbs of their own. \u00a0It is the ideal model for the speech system of the future: \u00a0a constrained vocabulary to begin with, but ultimate customizability. Just like spoken and written language itself.\u00a0Of course, I didn't say all that in the post below. But it's the thinking behind my handicapping Google way ahead of Apple in this horse race.\ufeff",

The inside game consists of brilliant technologists like Todd Park and Mikey Dickerson and Bryan Sivak and Marina Martin who have passed up lucrative private sector opportunities to work inside government at the Federal level.I'm also thinking of past and present Code for America partners at the city level. Jascha Franklin Hodge in Boston, Teresa Reno Webber in Louisville, Beth Niblock in Detroit, and Rick Cole,  Peter Marx, and Abhi Nemani in LA all come to mind. There are so many people in government who are hungry for new ways of doing things. They went into public service to make a difference, and they want help from private sector partners who are working with 21st century technology and business models.The outside game has largely consisted of nonprofits like Code for America and Datakind, but now increasingly we are seeing commercial companies who are bringing new ways of thinking to government projects. Venture capital adds welcome fuel to the mix.I am so excited to be working with +***** on this fund!\ufeff",

   "content": "Why Common Core is Like Healthcare.govDraw a bold line between this piece on the failure of the Common Core initiative to improve math education and the failure of healthcare.gov (even though the Common Core has nothing to do with IT): \"The inadequate implementation can make math reforms seem like the most absurd form of policy change.\"This is the sermon that +Mike Bracken\u00a0and +Jennifer Pahlka\u00a0have been preaching. \u00a0As Mike puts it, \"We don't have a policy crisis. We have a delivery crisis!\" \u00a0We endlessly promote new policies that are supposed to fix everything, but pay little attention to what it will take to actually implement them.In an In an interview with Charlie Rose, Steven Brill said something similar about the failure of healthcare.gov in the disconnect between policy and implementation: \u201cThe way they managed this program, it was almost as if they thought that actual governing, the nuts and bolts of governing, is for peons. And they are policy people.\u201d (See http://linkd.in/1o0RSOj)In this particular case, there is little or no teacher training, no supervision:\u00a0\"The trouble always starts when teachers are told to put innovative ideas into practice without much guidance on how to do it. In the hands of unprepared teachers, the reforms turn to nonsense, perplexing students more than helping them....\"\"With the Common Core, teachers are once more being asked to unlearn an old approach and learn an entirely new one, essentially on their own. Training is still weak and infrequent, and principals \u2014 who are no more skilled at math than their teachers \u2014 remain unprepared to offer support. Textbooks, once again, have received only surface adjustments, despite the shiny Common Core labels that decorate their covers.\"By contrast, Japan took not just the ideas of how to teach math better, but also put those ideas carefully and thoroughly into practice. \u00a0\"In Japan, teachers had always depended on jugyokenkyu, which translates literally as \u201clesson study,\u201d a set of practices that Japanese teachers use to hone their craft. A teacher first plans lessons, then teaches in front of an audience of students and other teachers along with at least one university observer. Then the observers talk with the teacher about what has just taken place. Each public lesson poses a hypothesis, a new idea about how to help children learn. And each discussion offers a chance to determine whether it worked. Without jugyokenkyu, it was no wonder the American teachers\u2019 work fell short of the model set by their best thinkers. Without jugyokenyku, Takahashi never would have learned to teach at all. Neither, certainly, would the rest of Japan\u2019s teachers.\"This is a must-read piece if you care about education, or even just, if like many parents, you are struggling to help your own children make up for the terrible math education they are getting in school.\ufeff",

   "content": "\u00a0+Maria Konnikova's NY Times article about the role of time and attention scarcity in the cycle of poverty was arresting and important. It really echoed some of the issues that we've seen at +Code for America\u00a0- there's a section at the end of the article that is going to be quoted often by people involved in the business of improving government services:\"If poverty is about time and mental bandwidth as well as money, how does this change how we combat its effects? 'When we think about programs for the poor, we don\u2019t ever think, hey, let\u2019s give them programs that don\u2019t use a lot of bandwidth,' says Mr. Mullainathan. Instead, we fault people for failing to sign up for programs that are ostensibly available, even though we don\u2019t factor in the time and cognitive capacity they need to get past even the first step.\u201c'If I give people a very complicated form, it\u2019s a big demand on cognitive capacity,' Mr. Shafir says. 'Take something like the Fafsa' \u2014 the Free Application for Federal Student Aid \u2014 'Why is pickup for the low-income families less than 30 percent? People are already overwhelmed, and you go and give them an incredibly complicated form.'\"To him, the obvious conclusion is to radically change our thinking. 'Just like you wouldn\u2019t charge them $1,000 to fill out a form, you shouldn\u2019t charge them $1,000 in cognitive complexity,' he says. One study found that if you offer help with filling out the Fafsa form, pickup goes up significantly.\"It starts with empathyJake Solomon has another take on the issue, which he explains so well in his post People, Not Data\u00a0https://medium.com/@lippytak/people-not-data-47434acb50a8 about the work he and the other Code for America fellows in San Francisco did last year to simplify the compliance for Food Stamp recipients. \u00a0What I love about Maria's article, though, is that it gives another way of thinking about why complex government forms are even worse than they appear, especially when it comes to providing services to people least able to deal with them.\ufeff",

   "content": "\"We don't need new policies. We need better implementation.\"Last night, I hosted Oakland City Councilor and mayoral candidate Libby Schaaf at a house party to introduce her to my neighbors. In response to a question about what to do about one of Oakland's many problems, she said \"We don't need new policies. \u00a0We need better implementation.\" \u00a0And in response to a question about disengaged city employees, she talked about the ones who really want to make a difference, and are just waiting to be activated.That resonated so strongly with me, because just the night before, I'd been at a talk by\u00a0+Mikey Dickerson\u00a0about the healthcare.gov rescue effort, which sounded almost exactly the same notes. \u00a0It's easy to imagine heroic Silicon Valley coders riding to the rescue, but Mikey pointed out that they wrote very little code. \u00a0Much of the rescue work was done by the same people who built the broken site. \u00a0What the Silicon Valley team provided was clear management focus from people who knew what they were doing. They were able to debug all the bad process and broken communications between the various contractors who'd built the site, figure out what they needed from each of them, and then encourage and bring out the best in those people. They also had the guts and the force of will to get the recalcitrants on board. \u00a0(I wrote more about this at\u00a0http://bit.ly/healthcare_rescue )So much of the work we do at Code for America is drawn from the same playbook (though we usually don't have the kind of mandate that the \"Code Red\" healthcare.gov rescue team did!) \u00a0It's about debugging a process, making small tech interventions, but even more about helping \"the system\" to work better by understanding needs and figuring out why they aren't being met. \u00a0(See for example Jake Solomon's brilliant post about his work in San Francisco last year:\u00a0https://medium.com/@lippytak/people-not-data-47434acb50a8)We have a constant parade of politicians who tell us what we want to hear: that they have a new policy idea, and that if we follow their advice, everything will be great. \u00a0This kind of \"magic bullet\" thinking is what gets us the same dismal results, over and over. \u00a0To be sure, there are times when we do need new policies, and I'm sure Libby has her share of policy ideas too. \u00a0But getting away from policy and digging into implementation is so important! So much of the problem isn't what we set out to do, it's how we do it. \u00a0I love hearing someone speak truth about that.P.S.\u00a0As a city councilor, Libby is in a non-executive role. \u00a0If she is in charge of actual implementation, I'm super-excited to see what she can do. \u00a0If you're an Oakland city resident, I hope you turn out and vote for her in November. \u00a0If you'd like to learn more, I'm co-hosting another, bigger event for Libby at the new (still under construction) BlueSprout Maker space in Oakland next Sunday. \u00a0Sign up to attend here:http://www.eventbrite.com/e/libbyraiser-tickets-11878702519\ufeff",

   "content": "Great talk by Maciej Ceglowski. \u00a0Funny, smart, and with an important message. \u00a0Just like Maciej all around. \u00a0It is too long since I've spent time with him!I loved his thoughts on regulation, quoted below. \u00a0I don't agree with his initial statement that it should be \"illegal to collect\" certain kinds of data but do agree that it should be \"illegal to permanently store\" it. I think that's what he thinks too, if you read on beyond that first line.REGULATEIt should be illegal to collect and permanently store most kinds of behavioral data.In the United States, they warn us the world will end if someone tries to regulate the Internet. But the net itself was born of a fairly good regulatory framework that made sure de facto net neutrality existed for decades, paid for basic research into protocols and software, cleared the way for business use of the internet, and encouraged the growth of the commercial web.It's good regulation, not lack of regulation, that kept the web healthy. Here's one idea for where to begin:1. Limit what kind of behavioral data websites can store. When I say behavioral data, I mean the kinds of things computers notice about you in passing\u2014your search history, what you click on, what cell tower you're using.It's very important that we regulate this at the database, not at the point of collection. People will always find creative ways to collect the data, and we shouldn't limit people's ability to do neat things with our data on the fly. But there should be strict limits on what you can save.2. Limit how long they can keep it. Maybe three months, six months, three years. I don't really care, as long as it's not fifty years, or forever. Make the time scale for deleting behavioral data similar to the half-life of a typical Internet business.3. Limit what they can share with third parties. This limit should also apply in the event of bankruptcy, or acquisition. Make people's data non-transferable without their consent. 4. Enforce the right to download. If a website collects information about me, I should be allowed to see it. The EU already mandates this to some extent, but it's not evenly enforced.This rule is a little sneaky, because it will require backend changes on many sites. Personal data can pile up in all kinds of dark corners in your system if you're not concerned about protecting it. But it's a good rule, and easy to explain. You collect data about me? I get to see it.5. Enforce the right to delete. I should be able to delete my account and leave no trace in your system, modulo some reasonable allowance for backups. 6. Give privacy policies teeth. Right now, privacy policies and terms of service can change at any time. They have no legal standing. For example, I would like to promise my users that I'll never run ads on my site and give that promise legal weight. That would be good marketing for me. Let's create a mechanism that allow this.7. Let users opt-in if a site wants to make exceptions to these rules. If today's targeted advertising is so great, you should be able to persuade me to sign up for it. Persuade me! Convince me! Seduce me! You're supposed to be a master advertiser, for Christ's sake!8. Make the protections apply to everyone, not just people in the same jurisdiction as the regulated site. It shouldn't matter what country someone is visiting your site from. Keep it a world-wide web.\ufeff",

   "content": "The Myth of the Spoiled ChildThere is an interesting op-ed in the NY Times by Alfie Cohn, who has written a new book, The Myth of the Spoiled Child.The article opens:\"THE conventional wisdom these days is that kids come by everything too easily \u2014 stickers, praise, A\u2019s, trophies. It\u2019s outrageous, we\u2019re told, that all kids on the field may get a thanks-for-playing token, in contrast to the good old days, when recognition was reserved for the conquering heroes.\"Children are said to be indulged and overcelebrated, spared from having to confront the full impact of their inadequacy. There are ringing declarations about the benefits of frustration and the need for grit.\"These themes are sounded with numbing regularity, yet those who sound them often adopt a self-congratulatory tone, as if it took extraordinary gumption to say pretty much what everyone else is saying. Indeed, this fundamentally conservative stance on children and parenting has become common even for people who are liberal on other issues.\"While I most certainly agree with the premise of the article, that unconditional love is best for kids, and that, as Cohn says:\"Over the last decade or so, two Israeli researchers, Avi Assor and Guy Roth, and their colleagues in the United States and Belgium, have conducted a series of experiments whose consistent finding is that when children feel their parents\u2019 affection varies depending on the extent to which they are well behaved, self-controlled or impressive at school or sports, this promotes \u201cthe development of a fragile, contingent and unstable sense of self.\u201d'and\"Kids shouldn\u2019t be spared struggle and sacrifice, regardless of the effects. The second value is scarcity: the belief that excellence, by definition, is something that not everyone can attain. No matter how well a group of students performs, only a few should get A\u2019s. Otherwise we\u2019re sanctioning \u201cgrade inflation\u201d and mediocrity. To have high standards, there must always be losers.\"But it\u2019s the third conviction that really ties everything together: an endorsement of conditionality. Children ought never to receive something desirable \u2014 a sum of money, a trophy, a commendation \u2014 unless they\u2019ve done enough to merit it. They shouldn\u2019t even be allowed to feel good about themselves without being able to point to tangible accomplishments. In this view, we have a moral obligation to reward the deserving and, equally important, make sure the undeserving go conspicuously unrewarded.\"There is also something odd in the framing of the article, which comes across as a defense of all the faux rewards that are given in the name of self-esteem, when in fact, I think Cohn's whole career and his previous books (e.g. the classic Punished by Rewards) emphasizes the downside of what is now called \"gamification\" and instead argues for intrinsic motivation.So it is important not to read this piece too quickly, but instead to think about what (I think) he is really saying:* Focus on giving your kids unconditional love, unblemished by either punishment or rewards* But don't be afraid of giving them encouragement* And don't buy into the idea that to be self-motivated, they need to get \"tough love.\"I know Cohn's thought is interesting and complex, and without knowing his previous work, I could easily see people being confused by what he was trying to say here, thinking that it is a defense of \"helicopter parents.\" \u00a0Which I don't think it is...\u00a0\ufeff",

   "content": "How to Raise Moral ChildrenI thought this article on child-raising had a lot of good ideas in it. \u00a0There was stuff that was new to me, and stuff that was old, but the old stuff was worth reviewing, and the new research quite enlightening.Do read the article even if you don't have children.\u00a0The principles it outlines apply to our lives as adults as well, to leadership in the workplace and in the world. \u00a0And while I've reproduced many of the best bits below, it's well worth going to the article itself, because it is heavily linked to the original research.What matters most is not achievement but caringThe article opened with the familiar advice that\u00a0\"when parents praise effort rather than ability, children develop a stronger work ethic and become more motivated.\" \u00a0But it went from there in a surprising direction:\"When people in 50 countries were asked to report their guiding principles in life, the value that mattered most was not achievement, but caring.\"Contrary to popular advice, praise of character is more effective than praise of behavior\"Many parents believe it\u2019s important to compliment the behavior, not the child \u2014 that way, the child learns to repeat the behavior. Indeed, I know one couple who are careful to say, 'That was such a helpful thing to do,' instead of, 'You\u2019re a helpful person.'\"But that's not what the research shows:\"...A couple of weeks later, when faced with more opportunities to give and share, the children were much more generous after their character had been praised than after their actions had been. Praising their character helped them internalize it as part of their identities. The children learned who they were from observing their own actions: I am a helpful person. This dovetails with new research led by the psychologist Christopher J. Bryan, who finds that for moral behaviors, nouns work better than verbs. To get 3- to 6-year-olds to help with a task, rather than inviting them 'to help,' it was 22 to 29 percent more effective to encourage them to 'be a helper.' Cheating was cut in half when instead of, 'Please don\u2019t cheat,' participants were told, 'Please don\u2019t be a cheater.' When our actions become a reflection of our character, we lean more heavily toward the moral and generous choices. Over time it can become part of us.\"I think this is an important insight. \u00a0Internalizing our experiences and making them part of our identity is a key element of growing up.\u00a0Note: \u00a0\"by the time children turned 10, the differences between praising character and praising actions vanished: Both were effective. Tying generosity to character appears to matter most around age 8, when children may be starting to crystallize notions of identity.\"I will note that the advice for dealing with bad behavior (as opposed to good behavior) is just the opposite: \u00a0to emphasize the behavior, and not the character. \u00a0You don't want a kid to internalize the idea that he or she is a bad person! \u00a0That was the next key point, the distinction between guilt and shame.\"If we want our children to care about others, we need to teach them to feel guilt rather than shame when they misbehave.\"This is a fascinating distinction: \u00a0\"When children cause harm, they typically feel one of two moral emotions: shame or guilt. Despite the common belief that these emotions are interchangeable, research led by the psychologist June Price Tangney reveals that they have very different causes and consequences.\"Shame is the feeling that I am a bad person, whereas guilt is the feeling that I have done a bad thing. Shame is a negative judgment about the core self, which is devastating: Shame makes children feel small and worthless, and they respond either by lashing out at the target or escaping the situation altogether. In contrast, guilt is a negative judgment about an action, which can be repaired by good behavior. When children feel guilt, they tend to experience remorse and regret, empathize with the person they have harmed, and aim to make it right.\"...\"The most effective response to bad behavior is to express disappointment. According to independent reviews by Professor Eisenberg and David R. Shaffer, parents raise caring children by expressing disappointment and explaining why the behavior was wrong, how it affected others, and how they can rectify the situation. This enables children to develop standards for judging their actions, feelings of empathy and responsibility for others, and a sense of moral identity, which are conducive to becoming a helpful person. The beauty of expressing disappointment is that it communicates disapproval of the bad behavior, coupled with high expectations and the potential for improvement: 'You\u2019re a good person, even if you did a bad thing, and I know you can do better.'\"Children learn generosity not by listening to what their role models say, but by observing what they do.\"In a classic experiment, the psychologist J. Philippe Rushton gave 140 elementary- and middle-school-age children tokens for winning a game, which they could keep entirely or donate some to a child in poverty. They first watched a teacher figure play the game either selfishly or generously, and then preach to them the value of taking, giving or neither. The adult\u2019s influence was significant: Actions spoke louder than words. When the adult behaved selfishly, children followed suit. The words didn\u2019t make much difference \u2014 children gave fewer tokens after observing the adult\u2019s selfish actions, regardless of whether the adult verbally advocated selfishness or generosity. When the adult acted generously, students gave the same amount whether generosity was preached or not \u2014 they donated 85 percent more than the norm in both cases. When the adult preached selfishness, even after the adult acted generously, the students still gave 49 percent more than the norm. Children learn generosity not by listening to what their role models say, but by observing what they do.\"So true. \u00a0As I said above, all of this applies to adults too.\u00a0\ufeff",

   "content": "Journalism vs. Punditry: NPR's Kelly McEvers on Why Reporting MattersThere was a great segment on KQED Forum the other day with NPR correspondent Kelly McEvers. \u00a0Throughout the segment, she talked about the power of reporting. \u00a0She tells the story of when she was called to Bahrain for a government press conference about how all the protests were settled, and heard instead of how there was brutal crackdown going on in a nearby town that very day, rushed to the scene, and were able to report the substance rather than the government-controlled show. \u00a0But perhaps the best moment comes at the end of the interview, reproduced below. \u00a0(It starts about about minute 47:48 in the audio file.)Caller: \u00a0I was in Syria too, and it really bothers me that people like you that have such a rare and important experience, that you don't give your own opinion. \u00a0For instance why President Obama... or criticize him for not getting rid of Assad like he got rid of Quaddafi. \u00a0And I know your editors and people try to control it and won't let you but I think you could do that now and maybe you could just give me your comments. \u00a0It must be very frustrating that you don't give your opinion on what should be done. \u00a0You just report a story.McEvers: \u00a0Well, guess what? \u00a0The people's opinions are much more valuable than my opinion. \u00a0Like I was just a conduit. \u00a0I'll never forget this one woman. \u00a0I was at a funeral in a village in rebel-controlled Syria and it was the first guy to die in this village. And I was on the women's side, with the mourning, and this woman looked at me and she \"Where is America? Where is Obama? \u00a0What? Syrian children aren't as good as Libyan children?\" \u00a0She said \"You know something? We're not going to forget this. We're not going to forget that you forgot about us.\" And all I had to do was report that line. I'm sorry but I feel like that's 10,000 times more powerful than me getting up like some TV pundit and spouting my opinion. That's who I am. I'm a journalist. That's my job.\"How right she is. \u00a0What you choose to report is, of course, an expression of your opinion. \u00a0But the power of doing it directly, with other people's voices, is profound. Being a channel for otherwise unheard voices that matter can be so much more effective than explicit editorializing.via +Jennifer Pahlka\u00a0\ufeff",

(The whole piece is long, but has many great moments. https://medium.com/p/e83510811c37):\"It\u2019s hard to watch the Olympics on TV in America because of the way they package it for Americans, trying to develop a sense that we are rooting for our country and making a connection to American athletes. So much is fabricated, and I wanted to see beyond that. I didn\u2019t come to root for TeamUSA, although I do care what Americans are doing and how American athletes are competing. But it is not why I came to Sochi.\"What I found special occurred surprisingly not at any of the events we went to, which included ski jumping, ice hockey and ice dancing, but took place two different times before a big screen TV inside the Adler transportation hub. We had just gotten off the train and there was a crowd of people looking up at the TV. All of them had stopped. The Russians were playing the US in curling, and the Americans had their last turn in a tie contest, as the stone went across the ice. It wasn\u2019t clear who won until one member of the Russian team raised his hands in celebration. Another day, the US was playing against Russia in hockey, and in the third period, the Russians scored a goal to tie the game. Both times, the crowd erupted in cheers, and a swelling of emotion that led to chanting \u201cRUS-SI-YA\u201d, \u201cRUS-SI-YA.\u201dhttp://youtu.be/zLvEtT2HcZM\"Something extraordinary was happening, and I realized that I shared their emotion, not because I rooted for the same team or same country, but I could ride the lifting emotion and energy, and its sudden appearance was something we all could enjoy. That was it, I thought at the time. That\u2019s what I came for.\"\ufeff",

The most obvious thing was not just that there were few Americans in the crowd, but few Europeans as well. The crowd was predominantly Russian tourists. This was an Olympics by and for the Russians. There was very little international character to the event....\"Russia was on the stage, front and center, and even backstage. It was seen inside Russia as a triumph for Putin and the return of Russia to world prominence. It was also colorfully packaged as building the Russian brand for millions in a television audience watching from Europe and the US. Yet, as one American who had been to the Olympics in Vancouver said to me: \u201cThis is a somber Olympics.\u201d It was not a party for anyone but the Russians themselves, and they came from remote regions to get their pictures taken here, holding their own flag. Perhaps for them, like us, Sochi was a version of Russia that they had not seen before.\"Fascinating!\ufeff",

   "content": "Urban Office-steading in BrooklynOn Monday, I visited O'Reilly Media's small development office in Brooklyn, where Rune Madsen, Zach Schwartz, and Steve Klise\u00a0are working on our Atlas publishing tools (e.g.\u00a0http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/). \u00a0They are holed up on the sixth floor of the old Pfizer Building on Flushing Avenue, with a spectacular view of the NY skyline.But what is most fun about the building is the way it is being developed. Rather than being a polished office building all ready for new tenants, it is being developed piecemeal in an exciting kind of urban reconstruction. After I had a look at the small office, we went on a tour of the vast undeveloped regions of the sixth floor, where rooms with mysterious purposes still remain, in skeletal form. \u00a0(Apparently, this was the area used to film the Green Goblin's lair in one of the Spider Man movies.) \u00a0In some areas, there are cinder block walls with holes knocked in them. \u00a0(Sadly, I somehow missed pictures of these.)Up on the eighth floor are a cluster of small food startups - pickles, bakeries, juice companies. \u00a0They apparently make the building a delight, because they sell lunch on many days.\u00a0It struck me that this is a very different kind of redevelopment than I've seen in San Francisco. \u00a0Grittier, more frontier.I love it!\ufeff",

   "content": "I am somewhat appalled by the sloppy thinking of many of the Internet's latter-day critics. For example, in Joe Nocera's glowing review of Jaron Lanier's book, Who Owns The Future, I read:\"There are two additional components to Lanier\u2019s thesis.\u00a0The first is that the digital economy has done as much as any single thing to hollow out the middle class. (When I asked him about the effect of globalization, he said that globalization was \u201cjust one form of network efficiency.\u201d See what I mean about a universal theory?) His great example here is Kodak and Instagram. At its height, writes Lanier 'Kodak employed more than 140,000 people.' Yes, Kodak made plenty of mistakes, but look at what is replacing it: 'When Instagram was sold to Facebook for a billion dollars in 2012, it employed only 13 people.'\u201dThink about it for a minute. Was it really Instagram that replaced Kodak? Wasn't it actually Apple, Samsung, and the other smartphone makers who have replaced the camera? \u00a0And aren't there network providers, data centers, and equipment suppliers who provide the replacement for the film that Kodak once sold? Apple has 72,000 employees ( up from 10,000 in 2002. http://bit.ly/1lEY8HG). Samsung has 270,000 employees. \u00a0Comcast has 126,000. And so on.Of course, there was a much larger ecosystem of people making money from photography in the Kodak era than those who worked for Kodak directly, but so too, the digital ecosystem is far larger than Lanier's silly example suggests. An economic ecosystem is a lot like an iceberg. Most of it is underwater. And shallow pronouncements like the one above do us all a disservice.I do agree with Jaron Lanier's key point, as reported by Nocera:\u201cIf Google and Facebook were smart,\u201d he said, \u201cthey would want to enrich their own customers.\u201d\u00a0I agree with that point - and have repeatedly warned about the risks. See for example, my 2007 observations about lessons from Wall Street for internet companies, Trading for Their Own Account (http://radar.oreilly.com/2007/12/trading-for-their-own-account.html), and my repeated urgings for companies to create more value than they capture (http://bit.ly/1lF0d6y). \u00a0But I don't actually believe that internet companies are hollowing out the economy, and I do believe that many of them do think about enriching their customers. \u00a0See for example Hal Varian's analysis of the economic impact of Google advertising (http://www.google.com/economicimpact/) or my own analysis of the economic impact of the web hosting market on small business (http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/07/open-source-small-business-report.html).Contrast this with the damage to the economy done by financial firms such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, who have truly worked to enrich themselves at the expense of their customers and the public, and the Internet gets a pretty good grade.The full story of the economic impact of digital networks has yet to unfold, let alone to be understood. \u00a0There is an awful lot of blind internet boosterism, but the latest round of critics seem even more wilfully blind than those they lambaste. For more nuanced, thoughtful reading on the impact of the internet, Nocera would do better to read books like +Ethan Zuckerman's _ Rewire_ (http://www.amazon.com/Rewire-Digital-Cosmopolitans-Age-Connection/dp/0393082830) or Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolffsson's Race Against the Machine and The Second Machine Age (http://www.amazon.com/Second-Machine-Age-Prosperity-Technologies-ebook/dp/B00D97HPQI/).\ufeff",

   "content": "I read Brad Stone's history of Amazon, The Everything Store, \u00a0over the holidays, and recommend it highly. \u00a0To be sure, it is incomplete and doubtless has many inaccuracies, but it gives insight into the mind of a remarkable man and the company he has built - a company with profound influence on the present and future shape of our society.I had heard scuttlebutt that the book was hostile to Amazon. \u00a0I didn't find that to be the case at all. In fact, it increased my admiration for Jeff and what he and his team have accomplished.After Steve Jobs died, everyone was saying \"Will we ever see his like again?\" \u00a0I would always respond, \"What do you mean? \u00a0He's already here, and his name is Jeff Bezos. \u00a0He's the only other tech entrepreneur I know who has transformed multiple industries, and shown the ability to work his magic not once but many times. \u00a0He's been the misunderstood underdog who came out on top because of vision, passion, and persistence.\"(OK, since then, Elon Musk has shown signs of pulling off the same ambition. But the fact remains that Jeff is one of the most important and successful entrepreneurs of our time.)Because of my admiration and liking for Jeff, \u00a0I was a bit dismayed to see the book position me as an \"adversary.\" \u00a0While in some ways I am a competitor to Amazon, I think of myself more as a partner and friend than any kind of adversary! \u00a0And while Jeff and I have occasionally butted heads, first about the 1-click patent back in 2000 (a conflict that ended up with us as friends), and later about some of Amazon's overly aggressive business tactics towards suppliers (described in chapter 10 of the book), and about the use of a proprietary DRM'd ebook format rather than open standards for the Kindle, I have always been a huge fan.One of the things the book gets across is what a great learner Jeff is. It makes clear just how freshly he responded to the challenges of growing his business, relying on some uncompromising principles but also adapting them so that, as long-time Amazon employee Rick Dalzell described, he always engaged his decision-making around \"the best truth at the time.\" (Chapter 9, page 267) His intense curiosity is one of the most striking things about him.\u00a0The book also underplays Jeff's humanity, humor, and kindness. There are a lot of stories of how forceful, even abrasive, he sometimes is with subordinates - and I imagine that can be unpleasant. \u00a0But I also know just how hard it is to get thousands of people moving in the same direction without ruffling any feathers. And some of the changes that Jeff had to make to the company direction required enormous determination and force. I wish that some other leaders I know (e.g. in government) had equal clarity and determination.The book also really helped me see how deep Jeff's focus on the customer is. While I have always believed that focus to be sincere, I have also always worried that it would fade as the company became dominant, as is so often the case. \u00a0But the book makes clear again and again how it really is a touchstone for Jeff.I have also worried that focus on the customer isn't enough - that companies that become as powerful as Amazon also need to understand the complete ecosystem in which they operate. \u00a0The book's account of Amazon's sometimes brutal interactions with companies that it wanted to acquire, like Quidsi, the company behind diapers.com (page 298), and suppliers like German knife-maker Wusthof (page 300 and ff) makes clear that Amazon hasn't fully learned that lesson, and seems to believe that as long as customers benefit, it's ok to hurt suppliers. Sometimes that is true, when suppliers are inefficient or exploitive of their customers, but in other cases, squeezing all the profit out of suppliers' businesses is enormously short sighted. \u00a0The ideal ecosystem is one where everyone flourishes, not where one company flourishes at the expense of all the others.But I got a lot of hope from reading about Jeff's \"Amazon.love memo\" (Chapter 10, page 317-318), in which he analyzed why some big and powerful companies are hated, while others continue to engender love from not only their customers but their entire ecosystem. \u00a0In particular, I liked that one of the principles that Jeff distilled was this one:\"Capturing all the value only for the company is not cool.\"I've long urged companies to make \"Create more value than you capture\" their watchword, because it seems to me that building a healthy ecosystem in which everyone - employees, customers, suppliers, partners, and even competitors - can flourish is key to the positive impact that capitalism can have on society as a whole. \u00a0(See http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/01/work-on-stuff-that-matters-fir.html)The fact that Jeff is thinking about this as Amazon gets more dominant is a really good sign. \u00a0Some companies never realize that they need to be especially careful to create value for everyone as they get larger and more powerful.\u00a0My chief beef about the book is that it skimped on some of the really big management lessons from Amazon. For me one of the most fascinating things about Amazon is the way that it seems to have modeled its organizational culture on its software. Stories I've heard about the way small teams are organized at Amazon remind me of the way modern modular software is designed. \u00a0I suspect that Amazon has cracked the code of the problem that was once laid out to me by the CIO of Fidelity Investments: \u00a0\"We know about all these new technologies. What we don't know is how to organize our company around them.\" \u00a0In addition, I wish there were more written about the design of Amazon's internal services. When Jeff had the insight that led to the rise of Amazon as a platform - not only that its software needed to make the transition from a single monolithic application to a series of reusable web services, but also that those services should be designed in such a way that they could be re-used as easily by developers outside the company as by its internal units - he demonstrated a lesson that has yet to be learned by most large organizations.Take the recent healthcare.gov debacle. \u00a0One of the functions that the system depends on is income verification by the IRS. That lookup is, consistent with monolithic old-school software development, a tightly integrated part of the application rather than a true reusable service. If healthcare.gov were designed with the lessons of Amazon in mind, not only could the Federal healthcare.gov site call IRS web services to do income verification, but so could any of the state healthcare exchanges, or, for that matter, any private insurance company - or any company that needed to do income verification for any purpose.I realize that this is a general business book, and getting too deep on the technology might have scared off many readers, but I do hope that some future book about Amazon will give more than tantalizing glimpses of the interplay between the software architecture of a large-scale web enterprise like Amazon and the human and organizational architecture \u00a0that makes it possible for that software to be deployed in as agile a way as possible.I highly recommend this book. Amazon is one of the most important companies in the 21st century economy, and anyone whose business has been or will be touched by Amazon should be sure to read it.\ufeff",

   "content": "Google Teams Up with GM, Honda and Audi to Bring Android to CarsI'm intrigued but a bit skeptical about the newly announced initiative for an \"Open Automotive Alliance\" to bring Android to automobiles. \u00a0While I love the idea, there are two reasons I am reserving judgment:1. The insatiable desire of vendors to \"differentiate\" on a standard platform, without thinking about what kinds of differentiation leads to real customer value.2. The failure to understand that in today's world, it's not just about the software, but about data and services.This point is brought home to me every day by my Tesla Model S. While I love the car, I'm incredibly disappointed by its implementation of Google Maps (for which I paid an additional $3000 or so for the \"high tech package,\" without which navigation is disabled). The map display is awesome, especially the second turn-by-turn screen behind the steering wheel, and the directions are Google's. \u00a0But where does the traffic data come from? \u00a0Surely not from Google. \u00a0Any time I suspect there is traffic, I have to pull out my phone and use Google maps before I start, because Tesla's time estimates to destination are pathetically wrong. \u00a0Whatever data services they are using (or not using) to provide traffic estimates are completely useless.In short, I hope that automakers don't add bells and whistles to differentiate themselves, while neglecting core services that customers really depend on.\ufeff",

It's simply us -- and as defective or capable of goodness as we are.\"Today, several weeks into the botched launch of Obamacare's exchanges and several more since the shutdown, the faith of the people in government is weak and weakening further.\"This trend long predates Obamacare, and its sources are bipartisan. Democrats who favor more active government have tolerated an ever-more complex and impersonal state, while Republicans who want to shrink government love to showcase the breakdowns that complexity -- and GOP-led underfunding -- can bring.\"What's striking, though, is that both sides have learned to see and speak of government the same way -- as a disembodied thing, a mechanism separate from citizens.\"Democrats tend to forget and Republicans like to deny the simple reality that government is nothing more than our best attempt to do certain things together that we can't do alone. Like ensure that we are all insured against health catastrophes. Or keep toxic foods out of our babies' mouths. Or send humans to the moon. Or design smart transportation systems on Earth.\"When government fails, the proper response isn't fatalism; it's activism.\"\ufeff",

This is a management problem, and a cultural problem. The preferred method for implementing large technology projects in Washington is to write the plans up front, break them into increasingly detailed specifications, then build what the specifications call for. It\u2019s often called the waterfall method, because on a timeline the project cascades from planning, at the top left of the chart, down to implementation, on the bottom right.\"Like all organizational models, waterfall is mainly a theory of collaboration. By putting the most serious planning at the beginning, with subsequent work derived from the plan, the waterfall method amounts to a pledge by all parties not to learn anything while doing the actual work. Instead, waterfall insists that the participants will understand best how things should work before accumulating any real-world experience, and that planners will always know more than workers.\"This is a perfect fit for a culture that communicates in the deontic language of legislation. It is also a dreadful way to make new technology. If there is no room for learning by doing, early mistakes will resist correction. If the people with real technical knowledge can\u2019t deliver bad news up the chain, potential failures get embedded rather than uprooted as the work goes on.\"\ufeff",

It was always a promise of convenience (and automation and sleekness). What wasn\u2019t obvious, to me anyway, was that an Internet of Things could usher in a golden age for curiosity.

Where a new adventure \u2014 a new set of questions about our world and our place in it \u2014 was only a group friends and an internet connection away.\"Or as Stewart Brand said, in the memorable quote that opens the piece:\u201c[In] the last century, discovery was basically finding things.

   "content": "Why Government Investment Makes Sense NowI was interested to see what appears to be a Libertarian-leaning author making the case for government spending in the face of the current worldwide economic situation. \u00a0Frankly, I wish the US and Europe were investing a lot more in infrastructure right now, and putting idle resources to work on stuff that matters while credit is still cheap. \u00a0We'll still have to do that stuff later on, when it will be more expensive, because by then the government will be competing with the private sector for resources.From the article:\"Governments particularly in Britain and the Eurozone have attempted to fight depressed growth using austerity policies (in the context of expansionary monetary policy). The proponents of austerity theorise that by promising to bring down taxes and spending, they will unleash private sector spending by reducing future expectations of taxes. To me, this has always seemed like a boneheaded and Rube Goldberg-style approach. Simply, the issue of depressed private economic activity is far more complex than future taxation expectations. And aggressive monetary policy has not succeeded in reversing the depression (even if it has probably made the depression less severe). So it has been entirely unsurprising to me to see this approach largely failing. I approach the problem in a far more direct manner. The solution to lowered growth and elevated (and involuntary) unemployment is relatively simple.Eventually someone will start using up the idle resources. This will either be the private sector once it independently gets over its slump in animal spirits, or it will be the government. With such huge volumes of idle capital, interest rates will remain very low until stronger appetite for credit re-emerges. In equilibrium theory, the low cost of credit will by itself start to re-energise borrowing appetite by making more projects potentially profitable. Of course, interest rates are far from the only factor that borrowers take into account when seeking credit, and so it is perfectly plausible that the economy \u2014 as it has done \u2014 can remain depressed even with very low rates due to deleveraging pressures, low expectations and low confidence, etc. So if the market is ill-suited to taking up the idle resources any time soon \u2014 lying as it is in a depressive, irrational strop \u2014 the only agent that can do so is the state. The fact of low interest rates allows this to kill two birds with one stone \u2014 the state can borrow money (utilising idle capital) to create jobs (utilising idle labour), raising interest rates and bringing down the unemployment rate. And this approach does not require anyone to make accurate predictions about the future. It simply requires a market economy, and a state willing to employ idle resources when they are idle, and to ease off using idle resources when unemployment becomes low and interest rates start to rise.\"Many \u2014 including probably Hayek himself \u2014 would argue that using up idle resources in such a manner will not allow the structure of production to adjust to the new economic reality. The state, Hayek would argue is a poor allocator of capital because it lacks the informational efficiency of the market. I would mostly agree with Hayek\u2019s objection, and note that I favour a predominantly market-based economy. Government interventions should be kept to a necessary minimum. Yet, in a depressionary environment, the structure of production deteriorates as resources lie idle. Unemployed workers lose skills, lose competitive edge and spend and invest less, further depressing the economy. Capital \u2014 factories, buildings, amenities, ideas, etc \u2014 deteriorates. Young workers may enter the labour force but never find a job. Crime rises, and shady fringe businesses like loan sharks thrive as the unemployed struggle to pay the bills. The social costs of mass unemployment are exceedingly high. The adjustment occurring in a depression is more like a rot. And it is absurd to rot your way to growth. Instead, by lowering unemployment and using up idle capital (preferably in a mix of state-run infrastructure and technology projects, and lending to new businesses) more businesses can be born into existence. Potentially successful new ideas can be tried out, and may find success in the marketplace. The formerly unemployed get to develop skills, habits and ideas, instead of sitting at home all day doing nothing, or hunting for jobs in a scarce and depressed marketplace. And money will go into people\u2019s pockets, spurring investment and consumption, fomenting more new business growth. This, in my view, is the best shot at getting a depressed and rotten structure of production out of the doldrums and back toward strong organic growth. Sooner or later, of course, the private sector will come back and begin to use up resources. But that could be a very, very, very long way away. If we want the structure of production to adjust to the new world and to continue adjusting as the world continues to change, letting huge quantities of resources sitting idle seems like a bad way to do it. Targeted fiscal policy can change that.\ufeff",

   "content": "The Guardian just published Nobel Prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney's last known poem, \"In a Field\", which he wrote for an anthology to be published next year in commemoration of the one-hundredth anniversary of World War I. In the anthology, contemporary authors were asked to reflect on documents from the time.Heaney chose a poem by British poet Edward Thomas, \"As the Team's Head Brass,\" which is also reproduced in the article. It is even more poignant than Heaney's commemoration of it. \u00a0Through a conversation with a farmer plowing a field, Thomas' poem reflects on the emptiness of Britain, whose men went off to war and never came back. \u00a0Thomas himself joined their ranks shortly after writing his poem, and died in France the following year.The poems \u00a0reminded me of the plaque on one of the columns in Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris that never fails to bring tears to my eyes when I visit it. \u00a0It reads:TO THE MEMORY OF ONE MILLION MEN OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE WHO FELL IN THE GREAT WAR 1914-1918, AND OF WHOM THE GREATER PART REST IN FRANCEOne million men! \u00a0And that's just the Brits, Australians, Canadians, New Zealanders, South Africans, Indians, and others from the British Empire. \u00a0Never mind the French, the Germans, and (in World War II, even more destructive though less pointless, the Jews, the Russians, and the Poles).It is good to remember that tumultuous time, and to reflect on how easy it is for things to go awry, for the human world to spin out of control into darkness. \u00a0But even more important, we can use this opportunity to reflect on\u00a0how little we have been asked to spend of our courage, our passion, and our lives confronting the great issues of our day.\ufeff",

   "content": "Ireland's School of FalconryOne of the highlights of my family trip to Ireland in May was a visit to Ireland's School of Falconry at Ashford Castle in County Mayo (http://www.falconry.ie/). We took a group lesson - with an age range from four to 86 - and as you can see, a splendid time was had by all. Our instructor and guide, Aurelia, was knowledgeable, patient, and a great teacher.What was most astonishing to me is how lightly a falcon lands on your wrist. It's like a breath of air, so light and controlled that if your eyes were closed, you might not be sure it had happened.My pictures were mediocre, and so I didn't bother sharing them. These, which I just got from my fellow grandparents, Australian painter Pamela Griffith (http://www.pamelagriffith.com/) and her husband Ross, are magnificent, and give a sense of what it's like.Be sure to see the picture of my grandson eye-to-eye with a falcon!\ufeff",

She is a wonderful actress. \u00a0(If you've seen either The Help or Fruitvale Station, you will recognize her from those movies, as she bookends both of them with her expressive supporting roles.)\"But it's the less-known actors who are more revelatory. Ahna O'Reilly (who dated Franco for years) is astonishing as Dewey, the only daughter, recalling Sissy Spacek's performance in Badlands. Jim Parrack was a perennial highlight of mine on True Blood, where he played golden-hearted good old boy Hoyt, and Franco's use of him here is absolute genius. He brings naturalism and genuine soulfulness to his portrayal of oldest brother Cash. Logan Marshall-Green is the handsome guy from Prometheus, but he'll always be Ryan's bad news brother Trey Atwood from The O.C. to me. He made me forget about Trey in this movie by sporting a beard and a sometimes indecipherable accent and reminding me of Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain.\"\ufeff",

My favorite quote of the talk was\u00a0\"The most important resource you've got is your own ability to change your mind.\"He illustrated this point with the failure that was Nupedia, whose founders and community went on to create Wikipedia. \"It's not what you do first. It's what you do next,\" Clay said. \u00a0\"Wikipedia was Plan B.\" \u00a0This talk - given to open government advocates - is particularly appropriate in the context of the current discussion about failures in government IT procurement. \u00a0After all, if you what you've specified is Nupedia, and the rules don't let you change your mind, you never get Wikipedia...\ufeff",

But normal people do not announce that if their spouse does not give in, they will break all the windows in the house.Hard-line House Republicans seem to think that their ability to inflict pain on 800,000 federal workers by furloughing them without pay gives them bargaining chips. The hard-liners apparently believe that their negotiating position is strengthened when they demonstrate that they can wreck American governance.The stakes rise as we approach the debt limit and the risk of default \u2014 which the Treasury Department notes could have an impact like that of the 2008 financial crisis and \u201chas the potential to be catastrophic.\u201d Astonishingly, Republican hard-liners see that potential catastrophe as a source of bargaining power in a game of extortion: We don\u2019t want anything to happen to this fine American economy as we approach the debt limit, so you\u2019d better meet our demands.In this situation, it strikes a false note for us as journalists to cover the crisis simply by quoting each side as blaming the other. That\u2019s a false equivalency.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "How Beautiful Interfaces Create Trust and LoyaltyReading Farhad Manjoo's recent article about Google's new commitment to design and the difference it is making, I was struck by the word \"beauty.\" \u00a0Steve Jobs' success at Apple made the word a key part of the strategic business lexicon, and now Google is executing on the beauty game plan. Government needs to learn the same lesson.In particular, I was struck by the parallels between Larry Page's pursuit of beauty in Google products and White House Deputy CTO Jennifer Pahlka's assertion that one of the best ways to restore faith in government is to create interfaces to government services that are simple, beautiful, and easy to use. (Jen is also the founder of Code for America.)From POLITICO's profile of Jen when she went to work for the the White House:\"Jennifer Pahlka thinks of a good government website as nothing less than a way to improve democracy. If the site is 'simple, beautiful and easy to use, you feel differently about government'\" (http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/50-politicos-to-watch-jennifer-pahlka-94195.html#ixzz2g6FkSUcD)From Manjoo's article:\"With the rise of sleek, portable touch-screen computers--i.e., the rise of Apple--people were now interacting with software in the same hands-on way they do with cars, clothes, appliances, and other physical goods. \"Our expectations of the real world began transferring to the virtual world,\" [lead designer for Google Search, Jon] Wiley says. Google's designers needed to address questions that they'd scarcely considered before: How do you feel when you use the product? Is it friendly, exciting, disorienting? Is it beautiful?\"The evidence suggested they weren't meeting those goals. In 2010, Google conducted a series of user tests to find out how people felt about Android. The results were stark: 'A lot of people felt that Android was essential to their lives, but they didn't like Android,' [Android Design Director Matias] Duarte says. The robust abilities of the OS 'made them feel small. It wasn't empowering, but daunting.' The same could be said for other Google products. When you loaded up something made by Google, you were more likely to feel overwhelmed than welcomed.\"Page took the two goals, beauty and cohesiveness, and combined them into a single mandate for designers: He called it 'One Beautiful Google.'\"And the results speak for themselves. \u00a0I've often heard a similar notion from Jen -- that contemporary technology has raised the bar for government. When people can get information instantly on their smartphone, when companies like Amazon can have a product on your doorstep in less than a day, when these services are not only powerful but simple, beautiful, and easy to use, government looks even more like a bad bargain.If Barack Obama really wants to restore faith in government, and change the poisonous dialogue in Washington, he could do worse than pay attention to what Larry Page has done at Google, putting beauty and simplicity in government services at the heart of the legacy that his administration will leave the American people.Again, from Manjoo's article: \"While Page has never suggested a single design element, he was crucial to the redesign for the simple reason that he made it a firmwide priority. 'Only the CEO can get the entire company to focus on something,' says Wiley.\"Disclosure: Jen Pahlka is my fianc\u00e9, and I am on the board of Code for America.\ufeff",

   "content": "What I don't like about my Tesla Model SEveryone loves the Tesla Model S. \u00a0And I agree with most of the hype. It\u2019s a delightful car to drive, with a head-turning design, and all my worries about range have proven to be completely unnecessary. \u00a0(I do have the 85 battery.) \u00a0There are wonderful little grace notes, like the app that tracks the location of the car (which has already saved me once from losing my car in a vast airport parking lot, and let me decide that there was time to run back to the bathroom when being picked up at the airport.) The navigation system (with the tech package) is superb. I love that there\u2019s a small \u201cnext turn\u201d display right behind the steering wheel so you don\u2019t have to look over at the main screen. And the audio volume even goes to 11! :-)But it\u2019s not perfect. In the spirit of being helpful to the designers of future models, I thought I\u2019d list some things that I find less than perfect. \u00a0In no particular order:* If the door isn\u2019t completely shut, the car refuses to lock at all. This means that if your kid doesn\u2019t shut the door hard enough, and you walk away without looking, your car remains unlocked. The first time this happened, my car was rifled through during the night, and anything moveable was taken.* The control panel is so big and lovely, with so many options, that it is really dangerous until you spend the time to learn where everything is. You don\u2019t want to be looking for how to turn on the defroster when you are driving! \u00a0You need to figure out where all the commonly needed options are before you start. \u00a0Once you get used to it, it\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s a little alarming at first. Take the time to train your eye and hand!* The bluetooth is flaky. (What bluetooth isn\u2019t?) At times, it works delightfully, automatically switching to my phone when I step into the car in the middle of a call. At worst, though, the entertainment system got totally wedged, thinking it was connected to Audible on my phone, and having that non-working display even overwrite maps and directions. I had to restart the display. (Hold down both buttons on the steering wheel till it reboots.)* The key, lovely as it is - an art object in itself - is designed in such a way that it\u2019s impossible to put on a key-ring with other keys (except with a cord rather than a ring.)* There is no spare tire. \u00a0This is probably OK, but it worries me. And I didn't realize it till I got the car home. Tesla should do a better job of making this clear, and what to do if you have a flat. (The car can't be towed, has to go on a flatbed truck.)* Visibility out the back is mediocre.* It gets pretty hot in the way back for kids in the kid seats. (This is a known problem, and they\u2019ve suggested workarounds.)* I miss the little sunglass holder up by the roof that was sported by our Prius.* I\u2019d love if the back-up display drew lines (like in modern sports events) to show me the location of the sides of the car relative to the display. The wide-angle lens takes some getting used to, the car seems wider than I\u2019m used to (not sure whether it is, but it feels that way) and I have a hard time telling how close the wheel is to the kerb or other obstacles.There are probably other things that nag me, but this list will do for now. Just a reminder that no one is perfect...\ufeff",

(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2334649/)It is a heartbreaking tale of race in America, based on the New Year's Day 2009 shooting of a handcuffed young black man by BART police at Fruitvale Station in Oakland, not far from where I now live. \u00a0The movie does a beautiful job of bringing the victim, Oscar Grant, to life. \u00a0His struggles, his aspirations, his loving family. \u00a0It brings home that there are real people on the other side of injustice, that it isn't something we should hate and in theory but ignore in fact.After the movie, Jen made the connection to a recent piece on Medium about white privilege that covered it from a very different point of view: the encouragement of disruption as a key element of Silicon Valley culture. \u00a0\"By teaching primarily young white men to unreflectively 'break things' and reward them when they do, Stanford and other Silicon Valley institutions like YCombinator are incubators not for any kind of social change or \u201cdisruption\u201d but for the assignment of privilege to the people who are most likely to already have it.\"The movie and the article are a powerful combination.P.S. Not relevant to the subject of this piece, but my niece Ahna O'Reilly has a small but pivotal role in the film. \u00a0She is the girl who meets Oscar in the market, and then later recognizes him on the train right before the incident that the movie commemorates. \u00a0Hers is the kind white face that shows the common humanity that we aspire to, as the angry police show what we become when we let ourselves be ruled by fear and anger.\ufeff",

A wonderful talk by Svante Myrick, 26 year old mayor of Ithaca NY. \u00a0I think my favorite moment is when he talks about a young black man being asked (mistakenly) if he was the Mayor, and how that changed how he felt about himself. He'd been mistaken for a lot of things - a mugger, someone to be scared of, but never someone to look up to, someone in authority.I also love how he tells the story of how many people helped him, and why the myth of the self-made man is destructive. \u00a0+Jennifer Pahlka, who shared this with me, pulled out this quote:\u00a0\"Why is it important to tell the story that way? What does it matter how we tell our stories? It matters because if we tell the stories the correct way, we get the correct moral from those stories. And when we tell them the wrong way, the way we\u2019ve been telling them for too wrong in this country -- the story of self-made men and great men and women of history -- we\u2019re get the wrong morals, and from the wrong morals we take the wrong actions.\"\ufeff",

I have found 10,000 things that do not work.\"  I found the original source (and what appears to be a good snopes-like site for investigating quotes, quote-investigator.com.  Here's how the story actually goes (and it's even better, albeit a little longer), as told by one of Edison's long time associates, Walter S. Mallory:\"I found him at a bench about three feet wide and twelve to fifteen feet long, on which there were hundreds of little test cells that had been made up by his corps of chemists and experimenters. He was seated at this bench testing, figuring, and planning. I then learned that he had thus made over nine thousand experiments in trying to devise this new type of storage battery, but had not produced a single thing that promised to solve the question. In view of this immense amount of thought and labor, my sympathy got the better of my judgment, and I said: \u2018Isn\u2019t it a shame that with the tremendous amount of work you have done you haven\u2019t been able to get any results?\u2019 Edison turned on me like a flash, and with a smile replied: \u2018Results! Why, man, I have gotten a lot of results! I know several thousand things that won\u2019t work.\u2019\"The \"ten thousand\" formulation first appears in 1982.  You'll notice also that the comment was not made about the light bulb, but about batteries.\ufeff",

   "content": "I love the idea here that there are three capitalisms, \"Yeoman Capitalism\", \"Corporate Capitalism\", and \"Supercapitalism,\" but I'm not sure I agree entirely with Michael O. Church's description of each of them. \u00a0His description of Yeoman Capitalism is pretty good - this is the capitalism that Adam Smith wrote about, and it is indeed governed by an invisible hand. When companies are engaged in providing real goods and services to each other, and make money by satisfying the needs of others, capitalism works really well.I like to think that O'Reilly is a great example of Yeoman Capitalism. We make our money by providing things that people pay us for, and I like to think we've created more value for society than we've captured for ourselves, which is how I think it ought to be. \u00a0(There is many a multi-billion dollar company whose founders told me they started with a couple of O'Reilly books.)But it's not just small companies that can practice this kind of capitalism. The corporate structure and the \"joint stock company\" was a great invention: \u00a0a way to allocate resources for larger scale initiatives. \u00a0And there are still companies that use capital markets this way. \u00a0Amazon is a great example: \u00a0they have raised huge amounts of capital from financial markets and have used it to transform industries, providing huge amounts of consumer value in the process. Unlike, say Google, which was profitable without needing huge amounts of outside capital, Amazon has only been able to accomplish what is has with the aid of capital markets.I think many big companies start out this way, and only go wrong later in their lifecycle, when they are established, and their focus changes from innovation to preservation. \u00a0And that's where we get to Church's \"Corporate Capitalism.\"Church describes Corporate Capitalism as a kind of Feudalism, one in which the corporation is primarily concerned with self preservation and the perquisites of its executives, and co-opts government to give it unfair advantage. \u00a0That is entirely true,\u00a0but he doesn't explain how it came to be so. \u00a0Where this went off the rails was with the increased financialization of corporations. \u00a0There are at least three problems with this:1. Companies are often prevented from the market from taking risks and trying new things. \u00a0(Amazon is a stellar exception.) \u00a0I remember one entrepreneur telling me: \u00a0\"I can't do what I need to do to save my company. We're sitting on too much cash. If I invest in the future as I need to, it will depress the stock price, and we'll get acquired for our cash.\" \u00a0That was exactly what happened. \u00a0The company is no more.2. Things that serve real human needs but take too long to show financial results are abandoned. We see diseases that could be cured, but aren't, because there isn't enough money in it. \u00a0We see workers squeezed out to plump up profits, or not paid a living wage. (See\u00a0http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2013/07/18/why-mcdonalds-employee-budget-has-everyone-up-in-arms/)\u00a03. \u00a0Rather than being paid out of the actual earnings of the corporation, executives are largely rewarded based on the stock price. This leads both to outsized gains to executives, but also to a culture of manipulation of those prices, whether or not they are justified by the creation of real marketplace value. \u00a0And that, of course, is the basis for \"supercapitalism.\"Supercapitalism is the capitalism that brought us the mortgage crisis of 2009, the result of banks creating and selling financial instruments that were designed to fail. \u00a0It also brings news of recent shenanigans like Goldman Sachs' manipulation of commodities markets. (See\u00a0http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/business/a-shuffle-of-aluminum-but-to-banks-pure-gold.html?pagewanted=all)There's a better term for this: \u00a0Looting, as described in a 1996 paper by George Akerlof and Paul Romer:\"\u2026the normal economics of maximizing economic value is replaced by the topsy-turvy economics of maximizing current extractable value, which tends to drive the firm's economic net worth deeply negative. Once owners have decided they can extract more from a firm by maximizing their present take, any action that allows them to extract more currently will be attractive--even if it causes a large reduction in the true economic net worth of the firm. \u00a0A dollar in increased dividends today is worth a dollar to owners, but a dollar in increased future earnings is worth nothing because future payments accrue to the creditors who will be left holding the bag.\"\u00a0http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=227162That's supercapitalism in a nutshell.\u00a0\ufeff",

   "content": "This New Yorker piece by Atul Gawande has buried in it the solution to our under-employment crisis: stop focusing on financial outcomes for companies, and start focusing on results that make a better world.There are several accounts of extremely labor-intensive projects that have saved millions of lives (training in Bangladesh about how to treat cholera, given door-to-door, and a similar project in Uttar Pradesh to help counter infant mortality.)Gawande puts these projects in historical context by talking about how hard it was for the world to embrace hospital cleanliness as a life-saver, and the costs involved:\"Reactions that I\u2019ve heard both abroad and at home have been interestingly divided. The most common objection is that, even if it works, this kind of one-on-one, on-site mentoring \u201cisn\u2019t scalable.\u201d But that\u2019s one thing it surely is. If the intervention saves as many mothers and newborns as we\u2019re hoping\u2014about a thousand lives in the course of a year at the target hospitals\u2014then all that need be done is to hire and develop similar cadres of childbirth-improvement workers for other places around the country and potentially the world. To many people, that doesn\u2019t sound like much of a solution. It would require broad mobilization, substantial expense, and perhaps even the development of a new profession. But, to combat the many antisepsis-like problems in the world, that\u2019s exactly what has worked. Think about the creation of anesthesiology: it meant doubling the number of doctors in every operation, and we went ahead and did so. To reduce illiteracy, countries, starting with our own, built schools, trained professional teachers, and made education free and compulsory for all children. To improve farming, governments have sent hundreds of thousands of agriculture extension agents to visit farmers across America and every corner of the world and teach them up-to-date methods for increasing their crop yields. Such programs have been extraordinarily effective. They have cut the global illiteracy rate from one in three adults in 1970 to one in six today, and helped give us a Green Revolution that saved more than a billion people from starvation.\"It seems to me that rediscovering the kinds of tasks that require investing human capital to make real change are exactly the kinds of things we need to focus our economic energies on.Money and labor should follow the things that need doing, not be an end in itself, as it is so often in our distorted economy.\ufeff",

Minsky's ideas were applied to the Great Moderation in a 1995 paper by Steve Keen:From the NYT article:\"He suggested that lending standards would be gradually reduced, and asset prices would rise, as confidence grew that \u201cthe future is assured, and therefore that most investments will succeed.\u201d Eventually, the income-earning ability of an asset would seem less important than the expected capital gains. Buyers would pay high prices and finance their purchases with ever-rising amounts of debt.\"When something went wrong, an immediate need for liquidity would cause financiers to try to sell assets immediately. 'The asset market becomes flooded,' Mr. Keen wrote, 'and the euphoria becomes a panic, the boom becomes a slump.' Minsky argued that could end without disaster, if inflation bailed everyone out. But if it happened in a period of low inflation, it could feed upon itself and lead to depression.\u201c'The chaotic dynamics explored in this paper,' Mr. Keen concluded, 'should warn us against accepting a period of relative tranquillity in a capitalist economy as anything other than a lull before the storm.'\u201d\ufeff",

We played with his mouse prototype and talked about collective intelligence. \u00a0I urged the people who were doing an oral history project with him not just to focus on drawing out what he had worked on so long ago, but his reaction to what we'd made of it since.\u00a0I wish I'd been armed with Bret Victor's perspective back then; I would have gotten so much more out of my afternoon with Doug.\ufeff",

There are few applications of any significance that do not have a big data back in running in the cloud and those clouds data center apps need someone to run them. I have long thought that one of the big differences between modern applications and those that existed in the PC era is that in some fundamental sense the applications of today still have the programmers inside of them, continuously updating them, managing the data, and performing other critical factors in their operation. This is true of so many mobile apps, which appear to be operating simply on the handheld device but are actually operating in the space between the device and the data center.The series of videos that we are working on with Etsy for Ops School are an introduction to the skill set of the people who keep those applications running. This is also the focus of our Velocity Conference.\ufeff",

   "content": "Why Silicon Valley is not the second coming of the Gilded Age.I love +Steven Johnson's rebuttal of George Packer's piece in the New \u00a0Yorker, which repeats the tired refrain about Silicon Valley solutionism and the bizarre notion that Silicon Valley is dominated by Randian libertarians. (I think Johnson is absolutely right in his definition of a new kind of political persuasion, which he calls the \"Peer Progressive\", and describes beautifully in his new book Future Perfect.In this piece, I particularly liked Johnson's take on wealth creation in Silicon Valley. \u00a0While Packer decries the tens of thousands of millionaires as creating a new upper class, Johnson points out something more profound and important:\"Then there\u2019s the issue of inequality, which is where Packer starts, observing the rise of homelessness and the staggering cost of real estate in the area. No doubt about it, the explosive rise in wealth and income inequality in the U.S. may well be the single most pressing problem that we face, the slow but steady reversal of the last century\u2019s rising tide. Packer deserves serious props for shining a light on that disturbing trend. But here again, I think he gets the Silicon Valley part of the story wrong, even if his motives are in the right place. Early in the piece, he cites a telling statistic: \u201cThere are fifty or so billionaires and tens of thousands of millionaires in Silicon Valley.\u201d Think about that for a second: tens of thousands of millionaires, almost all them created by companies that didn\u2019t exist two decades ago.\"Why did that happen? Sure, companies went public or sold for staggering sums, but companies have been going public or selling out for generations without creating tens of thousands of millionaires along the way. The defining difference between Silicon Valley companies and almost every other industry in the U.S. is the virtually universal practice among tech companies of distributing meaningful equity (usually in the form of stock options) to ordinary employees. Before companies like Fairchild and Hewlett-Packard began the practice fifty years ago, distributing stock options to anyone other than top management was virtually unheard of. But the engineering tradition that spawned Silicon Valley was much more egalitarian than traditional corporate culture.There\u2019s a great book on this topic, called In The Company Of Owners, that documents just how distinct the Valley is from the rest of U.S. corporate culture. The top 100 tech companies granted 19% of their total ownership to non-senior-executive employees (i.e., everyone excluding the CEO and four lieutenants.) For the rest of corporate America, that number was 2%. In other words, when it came time to share rewards with ordinary employees, the Tech 100 were ten times more generous than low-tech firms. This is actually one of the hidden strengths of the tech sector in the US: its companies are much more competitive precisely because they are much more egalitarian in how they share their wealth internally. I would be surprised if there were any new industry in the history of capitalism that distributed its economic rewards to its employees as widely as Silicon Valley has. Billionaire founders or CEOs are nothing new. But multi-millionaire middle-managers? That\u2019s something else altogether.\"This is the paradox that Packer elides with his New Gilded Age narrative....\"For Packer, the lesson seems to be: the excesses of the digital-era super rich give us a case study in the growing problem of inequality throughout the U.S.. But you could reasonably draw the exact opposite lesson: that one way to deal with rising inequality is to make the rest of corporate America act more like Silicon Valley.\"I totally agree. The reason we have lost the middle class is because workers don't share in the success. \u00a0Supposedly, it goes to the shareholders, but the dirty secret is that much of the gain goes to the management. \u00a0A great book on the topic is Lynn Stout's The Shareholder Value Myth.\ufeff",

   "content": "Lovely piece about walking in Wales. I've taken some long walking holidays myself, and I love them. This sounds like a good one. But I also found fascinating the observation about walking as a social value embodied in the British landscape (vs. the ubiquitous car-only culture of America). \u00a0Dominique Browning writes:\"Our walk along the Wales coast got me thinking about how we build our landscapes around various cultures. In the United States, the car culture dominates. Of course we have miles of hiking trails in our national parks, but we don\u2019t have walks connecting towns and cities. Instead, we engineer marvelous highway systems that twist and wind along breathtaking vistas. Think of gorgeous Route 1 along the coast of Northern California, or the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway in the southeast \u2014 or for that matter, the West Side Highway in Manhattan, hogging the view of the mighty Hudson. If I wanted to walk from my coastal Rhode Island town to, say, the charming village of Padanaram, Mass., a mere 15 miles away, I would have to stick to asphalt \u2014 without even the safety of sidewalks.\"But in Britain, there is a disposition toward walking. The land is crisscrossed with trails that connect villages, and every day, no matter what the weather, people young and old are out walking. In Wales, the needs of landowners and farmers \u2014 for privacy, or for keeping animals penned in \u2014 have been balanced against the need for citizens to tromp through private property.\"Food for thought.\ufeff",

   "content": "Freedom is not Free: Photos and Reflections on The War Memorial of KoreaLast year, I was in Korea shortly before Memorial Day. \u00a0I posted a photo album of the War Memorial of Korea in Seoul, and for some reason, Google+ deleted the post the next day. I decided to wait till Memorial Day this year to repost.Far and away the most interesting tourist destination I went to in Seoul was the War Memorial. I found it moving and beautiful.It is grandiose in its emotion, thought provoking in its storytelling, humbling in its national pride.It's hard not to look at this monumental sculpture with skyscrapers in the background, in the heart of a bustling modern city, while a mere 30 miles away, people live in abject poverty without enough to eat, under the thumb of a dictatorship that, sixty years ago tried to extend its reach over the entire peninsula. \u00a0If the people of South Korea hadn't fought back, if the US and the 20 other nations that made up the UN forces in support of South Korea hadn't joined in the fight, this entire country, one of the most advanced in the world today, wouldn't exist. \u00a0The people have reason to be proud.It's easy to be critical of the military in this era of American wars that ask no sacrifice from the general public (they are simply put on the national credit card, to be paid by future generations) and thus face no test of public assent to whether they are necessary or truly justified. \u00a0And so it's easy to forget that there is a time when you do have to stand and fight. \u00a0I have always had a soft spot for tales of valor. My kids used to laugh at me because I'd tear up telling them the story of the Battle of Britain, or Thermopylae, or the Siege of Malta. \u00a0The Korean War was not really on my radar till now. \u00a0Now, I'm hungry for the stories.I loved the caption on the monumental bronze sculptures outside the Memorial building: \u00a0Freedom is not Free. It seems appropriate to post these photos on Memorial Day, the holiday on which we in the USA give thanks to those who paid the price.One part of the monument, depicting the reunification on the battlefield of two brothers, one fighting for South Korea, the other for the North, is also extraordinarily moving. \u00a0The crack symbolizes the broken nation that they hope will one day be healed.Perhaps most stunning of all is the chapel, if I can call it that, at the heart of the monument. A beam of light falls from the top of a dome 20 or 30 meters up, illuminating the water in a massive bowl, overflowing in a constant stream. \u00a0Photos can't do it justice. \u00a0It is truly magical.I had the great good fortune to have the room to myself for ten or fifteen minutes of meditation, before a crowd of schoolchildren shattered the timelessness of the place. \u00a0This is a wonderful place for children, closer to Disneyland than to a normal museum. There are wonderful life-size dioramas of the hard life during the war. \u00a0Outside there are planes and tanks and ships to climb on. In the basement, there are records of other wars - the long medieval wars against various Chinese empires, the Mongolians, the Japanese. Models of ships and Korean knights on horseback and castles. \u00a0The exhibits are sparse, with most of the information provided by video rather than text (and none of it in English.)There is less focus on facts than in a typical museum, and much more on a sense of national pride. In fact, it really isn't a museum, though it serves as one. \u00a0It is a shrine to those who gave their lives that this country might exist, a thank you, a place of honor and memory.#MemorialDay\ufeff",

   "content": "The day before yesterday, on my Irish family holiday, my mother and daughter and I visited Fota House, an old estate near Cork. We only had time for the tour of the downstairs (though we did manage a peek into the dining room.)  Note the hidden door from the dining room to the servants' corridor, complete with plaster.The reason for sharing publicly is to correct some of the impressions from Downton Abbey.  First off - there are far too few servants at Downton. The staff at Fota, for a family of four, was about twenty, with another thirty or forty to handle the grounds.The kitchen must have been terribly hot! There were four different ovens, a giant roasting spit, and three giant charcoal fired burners for pots.There were separate staircases for the female staff and the male staff, so they wouldn't have occasion to fraternize on the stairs.The scullery was typically separate from the kitchen, since otherwise steam from the washing would spoil the food.  The scullery sink was unusually low, because it was typically a young girl, not fully grown, who washed dishes and clothes from before dawn till evening.  On the other hand, footmen were selected for height, and the taller they were,  the more they were paid.There were a few other interesting tidbits:In Ireland, the Butler, the Housekeeper, and the Cook would all have been Protestant. Only the lower servants would have been Catholic.As in Downton, the cook had a privileged position, and it was a rare master or mistress who argued with whatever the cook provided. There was an account of one of the ladies of Fota who did argue with her cook, and it was considered quite a phenomenon!Pilferage by servants was a concern (at least in Ireland). There was a story of one housekeeper who made the servants whistle all the way from the kitchen so that they couldn't eat any tidbits from the plates on the way to the dining room!The estate was so large that it now includes a wild animal park (effectively, a zoo, with the animals having lots of room to range free), an arboretum, and the house, originally built in the 1820s on the site of a much earlier hunting lodge belonging to the same family.Surprisingly, the house was still occupied in the old style until 1975! The lady of the house was still being served breakfast by a butler in full dress within the lifetime of many of us.  So Downton Abbey is not as distant as it might have appeared.  Of course, at the time of Downton Abbey, there were far more servants. I was surprised to learn that in 1911, \"domestic service\" was the second largest source of employment in the UK.\ufeff",

This piece is about the bundles of cash that go to Hamid Karzai, and how it ought to be spent. \u00a0If you read only one thing today, let it be this.\ufeff",

   "content": "I just got my Google Glass last night, and it's been a long time since a tech gadget has had me grinning ear to ear so often. I was at the  #tech4dem \u00a0event, and let +Marci Harris\u00a0and +Macon Phillips\u00a0try on my Glass. Both of them quickly got the same big grin!It's not at all what people expect! \u00a0It's a magical experience. \u00a0I haven't yet been quite able to put my finger on why it feels that way, but I think it's the immediacy. Rather than fumbling for your phone, then opening the camera app, you can take a picture or a video with a touch, and share it with another touch. You can also talk to the device, taking pictures, doing google searches, getting directions, or sending emails or texts, without ever touching the devices. (You can wake it up with a touch or by tossing your head slightly.)A couple of comments:1. People have this notion that it's privacy-invading. \u00a0It really isn't. It's pretty easy for people you're interacting with to see when the device is on - the lit-up screen is viewable from the other side. \u00a0Yes, you can quickly take a photo or video, but only with either \u00a0a voice command, or a push of a button on the frame, so it's clearly noticeable.\u00a02. People also have the notion that you won't be able to tell when someone is talking to you and when they are on the device. Again, that's just not true. It sits above your eyes and it's very clear when someone is looking up at the screen rather than looking at you.3.\u00a0Speech is the natural interface for this device, but there are also a lot of gestures on the frame that control it. \u00a0It's elegant and intuitive. But some of the magic is the immediacy of talking to it, or touching it, and having something happen.So far, there's a lot that's still buggy, so it isn't ready for consumer adoption. For example, it is supposed to integrate with your contacts, so you can text and email contacts from the device, but so far, I've found it not integrating well with my contacts. \u00a0It picks the first phone number from the contact, rather than looking at the field that says \"mobile,\" and there isn't an easy way to change that. And when I edited the contact (something the management app lets you do), the edited contact doesn't appear to sync with Glass. \u00a0So there's a lot more integration to do.On the other hand, photos seamlessly upload into G+ along with the stream from your phone. \u00a0Photos and videos are remarkably good.\ufeff",

   "content": "\"What the dead don't know piles up, though we don't notice it at first.\" Brilliant elegy for his wife by New Yorker writer Roger Angell.Unfortunately, the so-called \"digital edition\" makes it almost impossible to read this online, at least on my laptop. \u00a0And it makes it even more difficult to share enough in the way of tidbits to encourage you to read it.But trust me, it was a lovely piece, about how history passes the dead by, and how what \"they don't know\" puts them further and further away from us over time. \u00a0This is beautifully written, deeply moving, and expands how you see the world in the way that only the best writing can.A good argument for subscribing to _The New Yorke_r in print, and keeping old copies around. \u00a0(This one was from last November.)\ufeff",

This is the command console from the Apollo spacecraft . Today, our computers are sleeker and more powerful, but our aim is set much lower. What an inspiration the \"Mercury 7\" were when I was a child; as a teenager, how I thrilled to the grainy telecast of those first steps on the moon! I never dreamed it would take us so long to get back. I'm really delighted by the initiative of entrepreneurs like +***** of SpaceX, and +Edward Lu of the B612 Foundation, who are taking us back to space with big dreams, but I also have to lament that we seem to have lost the shared will to greatness. As I've often said (echoing, unknowingly until recently, Abraham Lincoln), government is a means of collective action, of doing things that are too ambitious for individuals and even big companies. Our space program was such a big, shared initiative. And I miss it. In our focus on \"small government\", we've also embraced small dreams, and no longer seem willing to make big bets on the future. The work of Elon and others was made possible by big investments that we made in this age when computers were the size of washing machines, and had less power than our disposables. It was our courage and will and our dreams that made the difference."

   "content": "Crushing national debts, economic revolutions, and extraordinary popular delusionsI just came across this fabulous paper by Andrew Odlyzko, which opens as follows:\"A superpower with crippling debt, exorbitant taxes, glaring inequality, wages far exceeding those of competitors, high and persistent unemployment, lack of basic workplace skills, malnutrition, a rapidly growing rival across the ocean to the West, heated debates about the role of government in the economy, and widespread pessimism about the future. Could that be any country but the U.S. today, with China as the looming threat? Toss in costly military misadventures in the Middle East, Greece unable to pay its debts, a sclerotic domestic legal system clogging up the economy, and the rising competitor \ufb02outing copyright and other property rights and relying on slave labor, and the case seems clinched. Yet this is also an accurate description of Britain around 1850, with the United States as the transatlantic rival. Surprisingly, what followed was an explosive acceleration of the Industrial Revolution that saw the UK sprint ahead of others during the \u201cGreat Victorian Boom\u201d of the third quarter of the 19th century.\"\ufeff",

When regulatory systems work, we take them for granted.For example, without the \"regulation\" imposed by anti-spam efforts on the net, email would be unusable, search results would be useless, and reasonable discussions on blogs and other online forums impossible. Without the regulatory efforts of credit card fraud detection, e-commerce would be impossible. Without the regulatory efforts of the fuel injection system in your car, the traffic control system on a subway system, or the autopilot in an aircraft, transportation would be reduced to a crawl.Each of these positive regulatory examples teaches us something about how to reinvent government regulation. \u00a0That's a topic I'll be exploring in conversation with +Matt Cutts\u00a0of the Google Search team, Sophie Raseman of the US Department of Treasury, and +Brandon Ballinger, the co-founder of Sift Science, an anti-fraud internet startup.(It's also worth thinking about how Amazon ratings, eBay reputation, NetFlix recommendations, Yelp reviews, and other reputation systems are also examples of regulatory systems that can potentially replace, augment, or transform our notion of the regulator as gatekeeper or policeman into a notion of a system that helps us get where we want to go.)I don't have answers. I do have questions. I'm hoping that I can get a whole lot of people, both inside and outside government, thinking with me.\ufeff",

Don't try to get to the normal parking near the Jefferson Memorial. Park on city streets over in Foggy Bottom if you can, and walk from there, starting at the MLK end. It's a longer walk, but less time overall.\ufeff",

When police wear cameras documenting their interactions with citizens, complaints go way down.This is a nice confirmation of David Brin's Surveillance Society hypothesis, that if much broader surveillance by government and business is, as is likely, inevitable, one of the best things we can do is provide citizens with the ability to watch back. \u00a0Interesting, here, though, is that it's not citizens with cellphones, but cops wearing always-on cameras, that provide the check on police behavior. \u00a0From the article:\"The results from the first 12 months [of the study] are striking. Even with only half of the 54 uniformed patrol officers wearing cameras at any given time, the department over all had an 88 percent decline in the number of complaints filed against officers, compared with the 12 months before the study, to 3 from 24.\"\"Rialto\u2019s police officers also used force nearly 60 percent less often \u2014 in 25 instances, compared with 61. When force was used, it was twice as likely to have been applied by the officers who weren\u2019t wearing cameras during that shift, the study found. And, lest skeptics think that the officers with cameras are selective about which encounters they record, Mr. Farrar noted that those officers who apply force while wearing a camera have always captured the incident on video.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "A Surprisingly Entertaining and Informative Hatchet JobI read Evgeny Morozov's profile of me with a kind of bemused fascination. It's well researched and captures many of my ideas, but then twists each of them in order to serve Morozov's own ends. Truth and untruth are so cleverly mixed that I'm sure that someone unfamiliar with me and my work might come away convinced that I am indeed the \"hustler\" that Morozov depicts.I suspect Morozov and I agree on many things about the Internet and its effect on society, though you'd never think so from what he's written. \u00a0We differ in our approach to ideas, though. Like Korzybski, a writer whom Morozov correctly identifies as one of the sources of my thinking, I believe that language and the ideas it reflects are a map that helps us to see the world more clearly and that can lead us to our destination or can lead us astray.Criticism is useful for any thinker. Dialogue and debate are effective ways to improve our maps. Unfortunately, Morozov's style of criticism fails precisely because it is not meant to be useful. \u00a0His disdain for engagement and discussion, his willingness to say \"I know what you think better than you do,\" \u00a0demonstrate someone with an axe to grind rather than someone who wants to find the truth.\ufeff",

First, I discuss our failure at O'Reilly Media to keep much in the way of records of GNN, the first web portal and the first web site to offer advertising; we just didn't given enough thought at the time to the importance of what we were doing. \u00a0In 1993, we were just a small company doing something we thought was interesting; we didn't realize how historic our work would be.Later, realizing the importance, we made an attempt to keep records of the 1998 \"open source summit\" by assembling links to various published sources, only to find those sources disappear or be redirected over time.The third failure was a failure of Google Maps when I was out of range in the Sierra, coupled with the unavailability of printed maps. \u00a0This leads me to reflections on a future without print, and the urgency of thinking about digital preservation.I contrast these personal failures with the design of systems like Wikipedia and Github, which have digital preservation and version control built right in. I urge thinking about the design of systems where preservation and archiving are not afterthoughts, but essential to the service.\ufeff",

I suggested instead that they ask for it to be open sourced, and turned over to someone who would operate the service. \u00a0That I'd be willing to sign.Google is entirely within its rights to shut Google Reader down, but it would be an awesome move to turn it over to a community that wants to keep it alive. \u00a0(Of course, those who ask for that option may not realize the scale and cost of what they are asking for. \u00a0It isn't any longer just about source code, as I pointed out in a debate with Richard Stallman back in 1999 (http://oreilly.com/tim/archives/mikro_age_of_infoware.pdf), when I observed that just having the code for Google wouldn't give him Google, because it was actually a service, not just a standalone program.) \u00a0I suspect that Google has been underwriting this service at considerable cost.\ufeff",

   "content": "Can The Republicans Be Saved From Obsolescence?This is a terrific piece about the demographic, technological, and ideological divides that threaten the future of the Republican Party.\u00a0Here are a few choice quotes, many of them from young conservatives who are dispirited by the chokehold on the Party by ideological elders.Bret Jacobsen, co-founder of Red Edge, the right's answer to Blue State Digital: \u00a0\u201c1.25 million more young people supported Obama in 2012 over 2008.\"\"while the Romney campaign raised slightly more money from its online ads than it spent on them, Obama\u2019s team more than doubled the return on its online-ad investment.\"\"Obama was the very first candidate to appear on Reddit. We ask our clients, \u2018Do you know what Reddit is?\u2019 And only one of them did. Then we show them this photo of Obama hugging his wife with the caption \u2018Four more years\u2019 \u2014 an image no conservative likes. And we tell them, \u2018Because of the way the Obama campaign used things like Reddit, that photo is the single-most popular image ever seen on Twitter or Facebook.\u2019 Just to make sure there\u2019s plenty of salt in the wound.\u201dThen there's Patrick Ruffini:\u201cThe thing I was struck by at RootsCamp was that in many ways, the Democratic technology ecosystem has embraced the free market \u2014 whereas the Republican one sort of runs on socialism, with the R.N.C. being the overlord.\u201d\"\u201cLet me tell you something. The Hispanic voters in Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico don\u2019t give a damn about Marco Rubio, the Tea Party Cuban-American from Florida. You know what? We won the Cuban vote! And it\u2019s because younger Cubans are behaving differently than their parents. It\u2019s probably my favorite stat of the whole campaign. So this notion that Marco Rubio is going to heal their problems \u2014 it\u2019s not even sophomoric; it\u2019s juvenile!\" (OK, that one's from David Plouffe.)There's an extended description of two focus groups that young Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson held in Columbus Ohio that is full of juicy bits, but too long to reproduce here. \u00a0Just read it.Here's Ken Mehlman, who played a key role in the Bush campaign, but who left politics and came out as gay: \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s an important book by Ben Wattenberg and Richard Scammon called \u2018The Real Majority,\u2019 published in 1970,\u201d Mehlman said as he leaned back in his chair. \u201cThe book explains in part how the Republican Party would go on to win five out of six presidential elections through the eyes of the \u2018typical\u2019 voter \u2014 a working-class couple in Dayton, Ohio. They\u2019re white, worried about crime, feel burdened by taxes and feel like too many Democrats don\u2019t understand these concerns.\u201d\"Today\u2019s typical voter, he went on to say, could be that same white couple in Dayton. \u201cBut here\u2019s the difference,\u201d he said. \u2018They worry about economic mobility \u2014 can their kids get ahead or even keep up. Their next-door neighbors are Latino whose mom gets concerned when she hears talk about self-deportation or no driver\u2019s licenses. And that couple has a gay niece and an African-American brother-in-law. And too many folks like the couple in Dayton today wonder if some of the G.O.P. understands their lives anymore.\u201dAnd here's Bret Jacobson again:\u201cI think the answer for a vibrant Republican Party is to make our North Star empowering every individual in this country to follow their own dream, free of legislative excesses,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere are millions of Americans who take seriously their religious culture as well as traditions that have been handed down for centuries. And the party has to empower them to fight those battles in the social sphere, not in the government sphere. That\u2019s harder work than taking control of the country for four years. But it\u2019s the appropriate battle.\u201dI agree. That's a consistent vision for the Republican Party. Right now, they have a set of values that sit very uncomfortably together. \u00a0We're the party of freedom from government, except in these areas, where we're the Taliban, and we want our religious beliefs to be backed by the power of the state.Frankly, while the two party system has much to recommend it (compared to fragmented multi-party coalition governments), I'd love to see a profound redrawing of the lines, since there's a broad centrality of thought in this country that overlaps with the best of both parties, and exiles the worst of both to the fringes. \u00a0It would be great to have a real debate within the core of common sense that spans both parties.\ufeff",

   "content": "Cory Doctorow on DRM, EULAs, and the loss of control over our computersIn his talk at the O'Reilly Media Tools of Change for Publishing Conference Author Day, Cory Doctorow made an impassioned attack on DRM and the creeping erosion of the idea that individuals should be in charge of the computers they use. \u00a0(Livestream is below; Cory's recorded talk will later be available online.)Here are a few choice quotes:\u00a0\"DRM changes your computer from 'What can I do for you, sir' to 'I can't let you do that, Dave.'\"\"The idea that you can make unreasonable things reasonable by just putting them in the fine print and shoving them down our throat has penetrated every level of our society.\" \u00a0Rather than saying \"Don't do that any more,\" we say \"Don't do that any more unless you put it in the license agreement.\"(The previous two quotes were in the context of the settlement of a class action lawsuit against the Lower Merion School District for spying on their students at home via school-issued laptops. After the settlement, the school district didn't agree to stop doing it; they just changed the \"terms of use\", requiring students sign an agreement in order to specifically allow it in order to receive the laptops! \u00a0For more details on the case, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbins_v._Lower_Merion_School_District \u00a0)\"The job of the artist can't ever be to be responsible for censorship and surveillance.\" \u00a0(His message: If I have to accept DRM as an author, I will have to change jobs.)\ufeff",

If you read the media coverage of our company, or of the technology industry in general, it\u2019s always about the competition. The stories are written as if they are covering a sporting event. But it\u2019s hard to find actual examples of really amazing things that happened solely due to competition. How exciting is it to come to work if the best you can do is trounce some other company that does roughly the same thing? That\u2019s why most companies decay slowly over time. They tend to do approximately what they did before, with a few minor changes. It\u2019s natural for people to want to work on things that they know aren\u2019t going to fail. But incremental improvement is guaranteed to be obsolete over time. Especially in technology, where you know there\u2019s going to be non-incremental change.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "+Mike Bracken\u00a0demonstrates once again in this blog post just why the UK Government Digital Service is the one to watch. \u00a0It should be the model for any national, state, or local attempt to harness technology to improve the delivery of government services. I love Mike's emphasis on the importance of delivery of services that citizens want over the development of policy.His best line, perhaps, is this one: \"\u00a0Delivery based on user need is like kryptonite to policy makers and existing suppliers, as it creates rapid feedback loops and mitigates against vendor lock-in.\"But here's a taste of the expanded version:\"One of the many lessons in my 18 months in Government has been to watch the endless policy cycles and revisions accrue \u2013 revision upon revision of carefully controlled Word documents, replete with disastrous styling. Subs to Ministers, private office communications, correspondence across departments and occasional harvesting of consultation feedback all go into this mix.\"Rarely, if ever, does user need get a look-in. User need, if referenced at all, is self-reinforcing, in that the internal user needs dominate those of users of public services. I\u2019ve lost count of the times when, in attempting to explain a poorly performing transaction or service, an explanation comes back along the lines of \u2018Well, the department needs are different\u2026\u2019 How the needs of a department or an agency can so often trump the needs of the users of public services is beyond me.\"It\u2019s usually the way with all large, rules-based organisations: that more time and effort is spent on internal logic and process than on listening to and understanding real user needs. But in the case of public service provision, it is too often a completely closed loop, the ultimate insider job.\"But it's not Mike's criticism of policy and the service of internal needs over the needs of citizens that sets him apart, it's the strategy he developed to actually reverse the priorities.\"f we put user need at the front of our thinking, the 5 steps look very different. When we created GOV.UK, we created an alpha of the service in 12 weeks. It\u2019s purpose was to create a working, but limited, version of what GOV.UK could become. We made it quickly, based on the user needs we knew about. (Using referrer and search information, it\u2019s not too difficult to determine mainstream user needs, like driving licenses and passport information)\"We can then design services, or re-design them, and rapidly react to user feedback. As we move towards a Beta version, where the service is becoming more comprehensive, we capture thousands of pieces of feedback, from user surveys, A/B testing and summative tests and social media input. This goes a long way to inform our systems thinking, allowing us to use the appropriate tools for the job, and then replace them as the market provides better products or as our needs change. This of course precludes lengthy procurements and accelerates the time taken for feedback to result in changes to live services. In the first 10 days after we released the full version of GOV.UK in October 2012, we made over 100 changes to the service based on user feedback, at negligible cost. And the final result of this of this approach is a living system, which is reactive to all user needs, including that of policy colleagues with whom we work closely to design each release.\"Looking at the highlights of what we have delivered, it is notable that delivery of services, whether they be information or transactional, has come before final strategy work is completed. Or put more simply, in an analogue world policy dictates to delivery, but in a digital world delivery informs policy. This is what agile means for Government and its services, and if delivered in this way, the ramifications are profound.\"Read the whole piece. \u00a0Also read the UK Government Digital Design Principles (https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples), which I have described as the most significant user interface document since the original Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines, and the UK Government Digital Strategy (http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/).\ufeff",

   "content": "A Copyright Case to WatchI remember giving a talk back in 1994, arguing that a non-fiction book was essentially a user interface to a body of information. I predicted that one day controlling the table of contents of a book, rather than its actual contents, might well be a focus of copyright and digital rights management. \u00a0(An article from 1995, http://oreilly.com/tim/articles/pubmod.html, contains some of these ideas, but not the prediction about DRM and copyright on tables of contents.)That prediction has now come to pass, as textbook publishers sue a startup called Boundless Learning (disclosure: I am an adviser) for organizing free educational content in the same order as popular textbooks. \u00a0The Slate article linked below lays out the issues.I'm sympathetic to the plight of the publishers. \u00a0After all, I'm a publisher myself. But I do think that textbook publishers in particular have only themselves to blame. They've made sustained efforts to lock in effective monopoly positions for leading textbooks by creating frivolous updates and add-on materials designed only to blunt the resale market for textbooks. Meanwhile, the price of those textbooks has skyrocketed, supposedly justified by lost sales due to - guess what - resale of those textbooks by students.I remember my own college experience. \u00a0I cherished my textbooks, and kept them. But if they cost $300 each, I would certainly have resold them. I couldn't have afforded not to.Boundless is definitely pushing the envelope here. I've even wondered if the publishers are right, and whether the detailed table of contents of a textbook ought to be a copyrightable element even apart from the contents. After all, pedagogy is very much a matter of teaching the right things in the right order. But then I looked at a number of competing textbooks, and their tables of contents are almost identical. \u00a0If it's OK for a publisher to compete with another on the basis of a nearly identical high-priced textbook, it also ought to be OK for a publisher to compete on the basis of a nearly identical low-priced textbook. If the publishers of leading textbooks want to sue Boundless, they should also demonstrate their commitment to the legal theory of the protectability of the order of presentation of material by suing each other.That being said, I do think that the devil is in the details, and that a lawsuit might actually be necessary to clarify just what is protectable, and what is not. \u00a0I suspect, as is often the case, that once publishers get over suing Boundless, they will find ways to leverage its ideas to actually make their textbooks cheaper and better, and to find ways to add value from master professors that makes students willing to pay. \u00a0(Think MOOCs with certification of the best students by the master teacher.)In any event, this is a copyright case to watch.\ufeff",

   "content": "Oakland sunrise from my backyardIt seems to me that the \"upgraded\" Google camera app does much less well with sunrise and sunset photos than in the past. \u00a0I used to get spectacular renditions, with the light \"just right.\" \u00a0Now, the default aperture setting is overexposed, and with -1 it's underexposed. \u00a0And neither is crisp. \u00a0(Look at my photo sets from Mount Athos in September for some previous sunrise shots.)On the other hand, I do love the UI innovation in the camera controls. The circle that pops up with a circular menu of options is cool and effective. \u00a0But I do wish they wouldn't mess with the default photo settings. \u00a0The old version made for perfect photos. \u00a0\ufeff",

I think of Twain\u2019s anguished reply every time I\u2019m asked to recommend someone or something I don\u2019t know \u2014 or am tempted to ask the same favor of someone else. Twain\u2019s message is ultimately optimistic: don\u2019t simply try to accumulate influence. Instead, come up with a good idea and sell it on its merits. The world will listen.\"Read Jon's essay, but be sure to follow the link to Google Books to read the original essay. \u00a0Boy, does this hit home, as so much of the unnecessary overhead in my life comes from responding to requests like the one Twain describes!\ufeff",

   "content": "\"Data Visualization is a Halfway House\"I've said this several times over the years. \u00a0Mike Driscoll just wrote a blog post reflecting on this thought. \u00a0Mike captured the intent of my quote quite well, but I want to add a bit more context.Right now, we have data visualization apps that are expected to serve consumers. \u00a0We look at crime maps, at various news infographics, at interfaces that help us to understand data. \u00a0But if you think about the arc of data services like maps, and follow the path from the paper map through interactive services like Google Maps giving you maps and directions on your phone, through turn by turn navigation all the way to the Google self-driving car, you can see how eventually the information is submerged into the service. \u00a0The car just gets you where you want to go. \u00a0The visualization is a kind of checkpoint perhaps, but the human decision maker is not in the actual processing loop.Applying this idea to business-oriented visualization, you can see how, as Mike points out, machine learning algorithms eventually are trained to do the right thing. \u00a0At this point, visualization is a bit like debugging - a way for humans to get insight into the operation of the algorithm. \u00a0It's most useful during development, and less useful once the algorithm has been perfected.There's an interesting gray area. \u00a0This model assumes that an area is adequately captured by an algorithm. \u00a0There will be many areas where visualization interfaces enable exception handling. \u00a0But more and more, expect services that used to require you to look at a screen and make a decision to just make that decision for you.(In that regard, see my post on Square and Uber: \u00a0Software Above the Level of a Single Device. \u00a0http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/11/square-wallet-the-apple-store-and-uber-software-above-the-level-of-a-single-device.html )There's a great deal of interesting work yet to be done on the proper role of visualization in man-machine interfaces; but one thing is clear, we need fresh thinking about just where the algorithm ends and the human interface begins.\u00a0\ufeff",

   "content": "Lincoln and the Art of Politics+Jennifer Pahlka\u00a0and I finally got around to seeing Lincoln last night. \u00a0It was a very fine movie, and Daniel Day Lewis, Tommy Lee Jones, James Spader, and Sally Field all put on bravura performances. \u00a0What I wanted to share though, was our post-movie conversation, how much we appreciated the movie's challenge to many of our assumptions about politics. \u00a0We always think of Lincoln the visionary statesman. The movie (and the book, Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals, by which it was partly inspired) shows Lincoln the wily politician, who was willing to bend the rules and use any means possible to achieve the ends he believed in, in this case, the passage of the 13th amendment.There's a wonderful point in the movie where Lincoln says to Representative Stevens, the most uncompromising opponent of slavery, something like this:\"A compass will point you true north. But it won\u2019t show you the swamps between you and there. If you don\u2019t avoid the swamps, what\u2019s the use of knowing true north?\"Lincoln was determined to get where he was going, not just to make a show of principle but to actually achieve his objectives. \u00a0This is something today's Congress would do well to remember.As Jen\u00a0remarked, the movie might also be considered \"the most pro-lobbying movie ever.\" \u00a0The three men hired by Secretary of State Seward to twist the arms of Congress (the leader of whom was played by James Spader in a masterful comic relief role worthy of Shakespeare) work tirelessly to buy the votes of lame duck members of Congress with offers of patronage jobs. \u00a0Who can approve the means, but how can you not approve the end?Politics has been described as \"the art of compromise.\" \u00a0It's very difficult to compromise in public; the back room deals that are so anathematized by good government advocates often play a very important role in getting to good outcomes. \u00a0That should be food for thought for the transparency movement. \u00a0How do we realize the benefits of transparency while still allowing the freedom of legislators to save face when making deals?Lincoln's urgency to get the amendment passed before the war ended reminded me of President Obama's urgency to get health care reform passed when he had the opportunity at the start of his first term. \u00a0Others advised waiting, but as the movie makes clear, Lincoln believed that it had to happen before the South capitulated, or it would not happen at all.I have no idea how history will judge Obama's actions, but, like Lincoln's work to pass the 13th Amendment, and LBJ's signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (after which he was said to have remarked to an aide, as he put down his pen, \"We have lost the South for a generation\"), it is a testament to political courage and conviction.For all we know, the current battle of wills over the fiscal cliff may fall into the same category. \u00a0Whomever wins that battle, the perspective of history gives us more respect for what may appear to be obstinacy or blind partisanship. \u00a0While much of the ugliness of politics is just that - ugly - there are times when the ugliness is an essential step towards something grand and important.P.S. The link below is to an excellent article about the origins of the movie and the art of politics that I found while googling for the \"true north\" quote. \u00a0It is well worth reading.It contains this wonderful line from the real Congressman Stevens,\u00a0that the greatest measure of the century \u201cwas passed by corruption, aided and abetted by the purest man in America.\u201dFood for thought indeed.\ufeff",

   "content": "I am not a lawyer, but with that disclaimer, I find the description of Kirtsaeng vs Wiley\u00a0in the EFF link below to be deeply flawed. While the case does raise First Sale issues, I think that's a construction put on the case by those who are trying to wrap a commercial dispute in moral outrage. The core issue here is whether the notion of territorial rights, and the ability of publishers to sell books at lower prices in developing countries, can hold up in the age of the internet. If that issue goes away, then I don't think there's any argument about First Sale.When I first heard about this case, I was outraged on behalf of Kirtsaeng, thinking it was a typical overreach by publishers. But when I heard the specifics - that Kirtsaeng had made a business of buying low-cost Wiley textbooks in India and reselling them on eBay, that put things in a very different light. Importing and reselling $900,000 of a publisher's books, in competition with that publisher, is not your typical \"first sale\" that comes to mind. I'd be pretty unhappy myself if someone did that with Indian editions of O'Reilly books.  And I don't think Wiley, or any other publisher, is making an attack on First Sale. \u00a0If the court decides in a way that harms First Sale, it will be\u00a0because of Kirtsaeng's lawyers using it as a defense, not because Wiley made an attack on the doctrine.It may be that low cost Indian editions ought to just go away, and that will create some problems for publishers, but it will create even larger problems for Indian consumers.The issues in this case are complex, and the EFF has lost a lot of credibility in my book for framing this case as an attack on First Sale. Putting this case in the same category as Capitol vs. Redigi seems quite disingenuous.  I'm really dissapointed in them.https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/12/first-sale-under-siege-if-you-bought-it-you-should-own-it\ufeff",

What I love about the app is that it makes the other side of the planet (and its issues) much closer in one's sense of the world. It makes me feel entirely protective of the animals caught by the cameras. I'm definitely paying much more attention to what's going on with them, and looking for ways to help.\u00a0\"I don't think you use an iPhone these days, but if you know of anyone who does, get them to download the app. The project relies on crowdsourcing to sort the photos for conservationists, so it's a two-way street.\u00a0\"I put the folks behind Instant Wild (at the Zoological Society of London) in touch with the community liaison for Arduino, and they're working on some projects together, including activities with kids building camera traps for use in the field. (The new cameras use Arduino.) They're about to post the data from their first year in operation. They'll be installing an 8-camera grid in a different part of Kenya in a special 3-month project, so there should be a lot more photos every day.\u00a0\"Nice people, cool technology, raising public awareness in a very positive way.\"http://edgeofexistence.org/instantwildYes, I don't use an iPhone, and I wish these folks would create an Android version of this app! I want it.By the way, Instant Wild is one of the many projects featured on the O'Reilly Animals site\u00a0http://oreilly.com/animals/, a project to raise awareness about technology projects working with many of the animals whose images we feature on the cover of our books.\ufeff",

   "content": "This post from former Federal CTO +Aneesh Chopra is a great summary of why those of us who actually engaged with the Obama administration on technology issues are big supporters. \u00a0President Obama has been thinking about technology in a profoundly different way from any of his predecessors. \u00a0His team has really internalized the idea that government should figure out what kinds of interventions really enable the private sector, and which compete with it, and do the former. \u00a0In particular, they have done a lot of thinking about how to release government data in such a way as to unleash the power of private sector innovation in the same way that we did it with weather data and GPS and mapping data, kickstarting vibrant and important new industry sectors, with initial heavy lifting done by the government but subsequent innovation by private companies. \u00a0They are now bringing this approach to health data, financial data, and education data. I believe this will lead to an entrepreneurial revolution that will also reduce the size of government at the same time as it grows our economy.(This is my notion of government as a platform, and I've been honored to engage with administration figures like Aneesh, Todd Park (the current CTO), former Federal CIO Vivek Kundra (now at Salesforce.com), Steve van Roekel (the current CIO), Frank DiGiammarino (assistant administrator of recovery.gov, now at Amazon), Julius Genachowski (the chairman of the FCC), Sean Greene at the SBA, and many others. \u00a0I'm super impressed with their intelligence, their dedication, and their strategic thinking - and that ultimately is a really good sign of those same characteristics in their boss, the President, who has done a damn fine job of innovating at the same time as he's had to pull the nation out of an economic crisis like nothing we've seen since the 1930s.)\ufeff",

We are down to the wire in the Commonwealth and nothing short of the future of the American Dream is at stake. We always knew this election would be close, but from my vantage point, it is far too close for comfort. That is why I'm writing for your help.Virginia's field offices are filled with passionate volunteers but there are still more voters to reach, especially young Virginians more prone to communicate online rather than on a landline. To that end, Tom Perriello and I are organizing a \"Digital Canvassing Twitter Power Hour\" on Saturday afternoon (1-2pm). To initiate the hour, we are hopeful you (and many others) will join in a large, loud, \"Thunderclap\".What is that? If you click on the link below, you can join at least 100 other active Twitter users who will post the same tweet at 1pm on Saturday. For the hour that follows, Tom and I will be posting specific, actionable messages to Virginia's youth drawing the clear choices before us in this election. You are welcome to join the conversation by using the \"#VAVote\" hashtag.\u00a0http://t4o.bo/vavote - when you click this link and sign up, the Thunderclap app will send the following message from your account on Saturday at 1pm along with at least 100 of our Democratic friends: \u201cGet out the VA vote for Obama w Aneesh Chopra & Tom Perriello. Use #VAVote to join the discussion & commit 2 vote now! http://thndr.it/PpNVRI\u201d\ufeff",

In one society, lower taxes on the wealthy allow them to drive very fine cars \u2014 say, $180,000 Bentleys. The streets and highways in this society, however, are riddled with foot-deep potholes.\"In the other society, the wealthy pay higher taxes that support well-maintained roads, but drive $120,000 BMWs. Some car buffs will grumble, but for argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s assume that all view the Bentley as the better car.\"In which society would the wealthy be happier? Because product-quality improvements cost much more to achieve beyond some point, the absolute quality of a $180,000 car may be only slightly higher than one costing $120,000. And because not even the most sophisticated automotive suspensions can neutralize deep potholes, it\u2019s little wonder that most people think the BMW drivers would be happier, not to mention safer.\"\ufeff",

W H Auden is the bird.\u00a0\"Another natural history lesson includes the maxim that in polite company, you should never discuss politics, sex or religion.

Unfortunately, however, these patients\u2019 access rights surprisingly do not include lab test results \u2013 one of the types of medical records that people are most likely to find urgent and useful. Due to the interaction of HIPAA (the Federal medical privacy law), CLIA (a Federal laboratory regulatory law), and state laws, patients can only get direct access to their their test results from labs in a handful of states.In 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services put forward a proposed Rule that would give patients the right to get their test results directly from laboratories. This Rule is still waiting to be finalized. In hopes of breaking the logjam, O\u2019Reilly Media and a variety of other players have written a consensus letter that voices our whole-hearted support for that proposed Rule and encourages the Federal government to finalize it promptly.You can sign the letter below.\ufeff",

   "content": "Politify is an eye-opening visualization tool for evaluating the economic impact of each US presidential candidate's policies by zipcode. \u00a0You'll see how Romney's proposals benefit rich zipcodes, Obama's benefit more middle class and poor zipcodes.Now, many will question the math on the National page that shows a $273 billion positive impact on the deficit by 2015 from Obama's policies, while showing that Romney's policies will increase the deficit by $566 billion.After all, haven't we all heard how much Obama added to the deficit, and how Romney wants to shrink the size of government?The big difference is that Obama recognizes, just as we do in our personal lives, that there are two ways that we can keep from running up our credit card debt - we can spend less, or we can increase our income. Romney calls for spending less, but he also calls for decreasing the government's income.Because after all, that's what taxes are - the government's income. The Republican notion that if you just cut tax rates, economic activity will increase so much that tax revenues will actually be higher, have been proven wrong again and again. \u00a0Reagan ran on that platform, but realized that the math didn't pencil out, and so he actually raised taxes once he was in office. \u00a0Ditto George Bush senior. \u00a0George Bush junior stuck to his guns, launched two wars that he put on Uncle Sam's credit card, and ran irresponsible policies that led us to the brink of a second Great Depression.Whether or not you think Obama was right to continue the stimulus program that was launched in a Hail Mary move at the end of the Bush presidency, you've got to recognize that most of what led up to the massive deficits the country faces today was the very same policies that Mitt Romney has become the standard-bearer for, and which are reflected in these numbers.I suspect that like all Republican presidents except GWB, Romney would quickly change his tune once in office, but I don't see why we should elect someone who has put forward a plan that makes no sense.At the end of the day, I'd love my taxes to be lower too. But returning taxes to the level they were under Clinton - a period of great prosperity - makes good sense to me. \u00a0And if you look honestly at the historical record, you'll also see that the last time that the size of government was shrunk was during that same Clinton administration.At any rate, ignore these comments. \u00a0Play with the visualization tools here, and think about what they say about what kind of country we want to become. These visualizations show how completely Romney's policies favor the rich. \u00a0I count myself among that number, but I'm public spirited enough to know that what's best for me isn't what's best for the country.\ufeff",

When she was first introduced to the idea of hosting fellows this past year, her reaction was, \u201dI do not need another fellows program. I do not need to baby-sit some people coming to Detroit. We\u2019re up to here with all the help and people wanting to save Detroit.\u201d\"Watch the video below to see how her feelings on the program shifted, and why. Listen to the words, but more importantly, watch the emotion on her face. Toward the end of the video, watch her literally light up the room with her smile, as she says, \u201dThis is probably one of the most wonderful projects I\u2019ve worked on in my career. I\u2019m so proud of the work that the fellows did.\u201d\ufeff",

Existing media companies claim that they need ever stronger and longer copyright protection and new, draconian laws to protect them, and meanwhile, new free ecosystems, like the Web, have actually led to enormous wealth creation and enormous new opportunities for social value. And yes, they did in fact lead in some cases to the destruction of incumbents, but that's the kind of creative destruction that we should celebrate in the economy. We have to accept that, particularly in the area of science, there's an incredible opportunity for open access to enable new business models.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "Visiting Mount Athos (Part Two: Vatopedi)(Part One: Megisti Lavra can be found at\u00a0https://plus.google.com/+TimOReilly/posts/gMfedQ4FkCA )My second monastery is to be Vatopedi (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatopedi_monastery ), the richest of the monasteries, which was made infamous recently through a financial scandal that helped bring down the Greek government. \u00a0Michael Lewis visited there and wrote up the scandal as part of his series of essays about the financial crisis, which were collected into the book Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World.\u00a0To reach Vatopedi, I must first take a bus to Karyes, the peninsula's only town (unless you count the port of Daphne, which I have not had a chance to visit but on the map looks even smaller than Karyes.) \u00a0The bus leaves at 7, before breakfast. \u00a0I skip the morning services, and instead wait outside watching the sunrise.Each minibus holds 12-14 people, so there are four buses arranged to take pilgrims onward. \u00a0The ride takes an hour and a quarter over winding, rutted, but thankfully very wide dirt roads that skirt the slopes of Athos. \u00a0The views are often blocked by the trees, but when they are not, they are stunning.We are dumped unceremoniously into the main square of Karyes at 8:15. \u00a0We are told that there won't be a bus to Vatopedi till 1.I leave my baggage on the sidewalk, and go off to explore the town. \u00a0Most of the shops sell religious icons, but there is a single cafe, and a bakery where hundreds of the same loaves I tasted at Lavra are pulled hot from the oven. \u00a0I'm tempted to try the bread fresh, but instead, I breakfast on a slice of spanikopita hot from the same oven.As I wander the lanes, I come eventually to another monastery, St. Andre, just outside of town. To my dismay, there is a bus leaving from there, not more than a couple of hundred yards from the town square, at 9 am. \u00a0It's leaving in 5 minutes, and there's no time for me to go back for my baggage. Why did they tell us to wait till 1? \u00a0Perhaps to give business to the town?However, when I get back to the square, I'm approached by one of my roommates from Lavra, who is also on his way to Vatopedi. He doesn't have much English, and I have no Russian and little Greek, but he takes me to a group of young men, saying insistently \"Vatopedi, now.\"It seems that if you have enough of a group, you can arrange a custom bus not on the schedule. Before long, there are nine of us.One of the young men is very friendly. He is Dmitri, from Osettia in the Caucasus. One of his companions has bought some of the bread, and they share it with me. Fresh, it is delicious.We set off. \u00a0A monk and Dmitri, the young man who befriended me, are sitting in the back of the bus. They begin a chant in Russian. \u00a0It is magical as we wind through the forest.We come to a kind of customs barrier a few miles from Vatopedi. It turns out that the young men from Osettia do not have reservations. Are we to be turned back? \u00a0Eventually, after much conversation, we are allowed in. \u00a0As it turns out, there is plenty of space for them, though there are more than 200 Pilgrims that night.At Vatopedi, the monks are much friendlier. In the office, Father Timoteo is thrilled that we share the same name. Many more of them speak English, including one young monk \u00a0from Australia, who shows me to my room. \u00a0The pilgrims are likewise more diverse.I had heard from one of the pilgrims at Lavra that Vatopedi is much more luxurious, but he mustn't have visited yet. \u00a0The accommodations are as spartan as those at Lavra. Though the bathrooms are better, the bedroom is quite similar. \u00a0If anything, it is a bit worse, a stuffy attic room that I am to share with five others. \u00a0(In the morning, I had a chance to see some of the rooms on the first floor. They are shared by only two people, with a small table, and much nicer bathrooms. I meet two brothers from Melbourne, one of whom has a son who is a monk here. They are accommodated on the first floor.)As the church and other monastery buildings are closed till the evening services, I go immediately for my walk. \u00a0Once again, I head for the sea. \u00a0Suspecting that the monks here also won't approve of swimming from their docks, I walk through the fields, eventually winding my way to a rocky beach, and along the beach to a small, empty church surrounded by scaffolding, in the midst of some kind of refurbishment. (Almost every building seems to have scaffolding, and both Lavra and Vatopedi are surmounted by enormous cranes, but I almost never see anyone working.)Beyond the church, there is a goat track along the cliffs. I hope that I can make it all the way to a small pebble beach that I see in the distance, but eventually the track peters out, and it becomes too dangerous to continue.I make my way down to the rocks instead, strip, and swim the rest of the way to the beach.It's a lovely, long stroke through cool, crystalline water. The beach is pebbly but comfortable. \u00a0The return swim is just as refreshing. I see small fish, spiny urchins, and a bright red anemone.After drying myself in the sun, I write for an hour or so - this piece, in fact - till the sun comes round the headland and takes away my shade. In any event, it's time to return to Vatopedi for evening services and dinner.At the service, no one asks me if I am Orthodox, so I go into the body of the church. It is dark and beautiful. Every surface is painted. I recognize some of the people and stories in the paintings, but others are from a history that I don't know, that thousand years of Byzantium that is so lost to the West. Saints, monks, faces from another age. I think how I am seeing the remnants of a civilization that flourished for over a thousand years, the religion of a great empire that is now dust, and survives only in outposts such as this, and in the hearts of its true believers.Dinner is much the same as last night's dinner at Lavra: a rice stew with vegetables, bread and water. The bread here is somewhat better than at Lavra.After dinner, there is a tour of the church. \u00a0There is a huge crowd at the front. I realize that they are all in line to kiss the monastery's sacred relics, which have been taken out for tonight's vigil. \u00a0As it turns out, I have arrived just in time for the monthly vigil, which goes from 7 pm to 2 am, culminating with celebration of the holiest relic of all, a fragment of the True Cross.It appears, though, that the relics are out to be venerated now, before the vigil starts. So I get in line, and like the rest, have a chance to kiss the reliquary containing the fragment said to be from the cross on which Jesus was crucified. \u00a0There are also three skulls, wrapped in silver except for one exposed section, which appears lacquered, and is available to be kissed. \u00a0The priest accepts various religious items from the Pilgrims, which he lays on the relics.\u00a0Later, I meet Father Gregory, from Cyprus, who speaks English and tells me the history of the monastery and the relics. Contrary to common belief, he says that the monastery here is far older than Lavra, dating back to the fourth century. It was sacked in the 9th century. \u00a0One of the monks hid one of the old monastery's most sacred icons in a well, then was captured and taken off to slavery in Cyprus for 70 years. In the time of Theodosius, he was freed and returned to a nearby monastery, telling his story. \u00a0The icon was found, miraculously upright floating in the water of the well after all those years.Theodosius then sent monks from Lavra to rebuild the monastery, founding what is now Vatopedi.\u00a0Father Gregory also tells me the story of the six reliquaries that I saw before the vigil. The first, he says, contains the belt of the Virgin Mary - it was taken to Russia a few years ago and venerated by 3 million people. Ribbons blessed on the relic help women to conceive, he says. The next reliquary holds a fragment of the cross, as I'd heard, and the third (if I understand Father Gregory correctly) is said to be a fragment from the reed that was used to offer a sponge of wine to Jesus while he was on the cross. \u00a0The three skulls belong to St. John Chrisostom, St. Gregory Theologico (if I've got that right), and from an unnamed monk whose skeleton, in an attitude of prayer, was discovered in an abandoned cellar after an earthquake.Father Gregory insists that miracles do happen, even now. He tells me of children conceived as a result of the Virgin's girdle, of lost objects found, of cancer patients healed at a clinic in Switzerland by wax taken from candles burned by the side of one icon, of a child dead of radiation from Chernobyl literally resurrected from the dead in front of his doctors by an image of another icon, which shone with a mysterious glow. Miracles are not just something to read about in the Bible, he insists. \"We hear about them here every day.\" \u00a0\"Come back soon,\" he says.In the morning, services start at 6, and go to 9:30. Breakfast concludes with the consecration of the bread and wine, which is passed out to all who attend, as at the Last Supper. The marble tables at which we ate come from a monastery in Turkey that was closed in the 8th century, Father Gregory has told me.\u00a0I go from here to the boat, and back to modern civilization. \u00a0But day in and day out, the monks of Mount Athos spend their morning and evening hours praying, chanting, kissing their icons. What for me is a visit, a time to unplug from the modern world, and a view into another life that has gone on for thousands of years, for them is a day like every other.There is no charge to stay in the monasteries. You are a pilgrim, and are welcomed on that basis. The visa to get into the peninsula cost me \u20ac30. The boat from Ierissos to Lavra cost me \u20ac21. The bus from Lavra to Karyes cost \u20ac7, and from Caryes to Vatopedi \u20ac5. \u00a0The boat back from Vatopedi to Ierrissos was \u20ac14.50. Bring a water bottle, and additional food if you like, since there is no lunch. I share details of times and costs because in researching the trip, I found practical information surprisingly scarce and often contradictory. \u00a0If you want to follow in my footsteps, your best bet might well be to reach out to Eleni Andrakis at the Sani Resort (http://www.sani-resort.com/en_GB ), who arranged everything for me.\ufeff",

The issue isn't whether what Aaron did was wrong - like Larry Lessig, I believe that Aaron was pushing legal and ethical boundaries.

It's so disappointing that so much effort is going into prosecuting someone who did something for no personal gain, while Wall Street miscreants get off scot free.There's no way that Aaron should face millions of dollars in fines and years in jail.\u00a0Here is a link for donations:\u00a0https://free.aaronsw.com/Here's some background on the case:\u00a0http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/09/aaron-swartz-felony/all/Here are Lessig's comments on the legal and ethical line Aaron crossed:http://mediafreedom.org/2011/07/larry-lessig-responds-says-swartzs-alleged-actions-crossed-ethical-line/\ufeff",

On my way out, I noticed a second sign hidden by a tree that pointed up a very narrow cobbled lane. \u00a0So I parked and walked. \u00a0This is what I found.If you're going there, it's easiest to park down by the road. \u00a0Walk in a little way and you'll see the cobbled lane going to the left. It's less than a hundred yards up the hill.It's not a big site, but fun to poke around. \u00a0And there's a great rustic chicken coop just opposite!Here's a bit more background: \u00a0http://www.mountathosarea.org/en/archaeological-sites/archaeological-sites/tin-archaia-akantho/\ufeff",

One of the oddest things is that each one contains a half drunk bottle of soda pop or iced tea. When I saw the first one in one of the double chapels abreast the road that you'll see in the set below, I thought it was just litter left there by a visitor. \u00a0But then there was one in the other chapel too, and in every one of the tiny chapels. There was also wonderful Greek Orthodox iconography. \u00a0But if anyone can explain the half-empty drink bottles, please do. \u00a0Not a terribly appealing religious offering, in my opinion :-)\ufeff",

I thought I'd share it here:\"I'm working on a map hack - crowdsourcing Google Autocomplete data for questions about Romney and Obama from people across the country. I'm interested to see if it turns up interesting regional differences in political attitudes, assumptions, etc. (I did a different map project last month on state stereotypes, which I just ran from within SF - http://blog.noupsi.de/post/28896819324/why-are-americans-so - but people were surprisingly interested the results).\"To eliminate noise from past browser history, Justin & I put together a script. So far, I've gotten about 60 people to run the script, but I'd really like a bigger sample. \u00a0My network is concentrated in SF and NYC, and I'm trying to reach a broader audience, so I was wondering if you could help by tweeting a link? The script, instructions, and a description of the project are here:http://justinhileman.info/article/the-autocomplete-maps/contribute/\u00a0\ufeff",

Those on the right will say that this is a hagiography - and they may well be right - but that doesn't mean it isn't true. I'm sure that there is much that is left out that may turn out to be negative (and that may appear in Lewis' book), but how wonderful is it to have an inside view like this of what it really is like to occupy the White House.\u00a0I have to admit that I really admire the Barack Obama who is portrayed here, and the article gave me much more sympathy into his decision making process. I learned a lot about how to be a better executive even (if only I can apply it.) \u00a0I wish there were a similar profile of Mitt Romney!\u00a0In a lot of ways, what Lewis did here is what science-fiction writer Orson Scott Card described so well in Speaker for the Dead. \u00a0He explains why people act the way they do, from their own point of view, telling stories that help others see deeper into that person's life. \u00a0\ufeff",

Please take a minute to visit this website to learn more and spread the word before November 6.I haven't entirely made up my own mind about this proposition. While I am concerned about cuts to education, I'm also trying to understand why we need new taxes to support education - what revenues did we lose and why? If we're raising more taxes to keep us from having to make hard choices (e.g. on public sector pensions, which I believe need reform), then I'm not convinced. \u00a0If we're raising them because politicians have been raiding the education cookie jar to fund something else, I'd also like to know that.I wish the information on these issues were easier to find, and that I had confidence that the folks in politics were actually doing their best to solve the problems rather than just going back to bromides in an attempt to paper over the problem.I'm not against taxes - even higher taxes. \u00a0I just want to know more what we're really paying for. \u00a0At any rate, digging in on this website is better than nothing.\ufeff",

   "content": "This fascinating piece in Psychology Today, \"Why I'm a Scientific Progressive\" makes an attempt to explain what evolution teaches us about market theory.\u00a0Here's a choice quote:\"the Republican obsession with smaller government is like a body wanting a smaller brain. (Brains have in fact de-evolved in several species, but that\u2019s always because the body or the environment became simpler. Once a barnacle attaches to a surface, it digests its brain because it doesn\u2019t need to manage motion anymore.) It would make sense if Republicans said they wanted a more efficient government. Who wouldn\u2019t want that? But that is very different from wanting smaller government. Wanting a smaller government is precisely equivalent to wanting a simpler society.\"I don't completely agree with that, though I do agree with the notion that the complexity of society and the complexity of government do go hand in hand.\ufeff",

This is termed a social 'instrument'. Over time the 'instrument' becomes an 'institution' with a whole caste dedicated to maintaining and preserving that unique advantage. This group does everything to preserve the status quo -- from which they draw all of their power and prestige. However, the world always changes, and it is this resistance to change among those who wield power in a society that helps to topple civilizations by preventing nimble adaptation to new conditions.\"But perhaps my favorite:\"the fundamental question of our time is whether technology will liberate us or destroy us. \u00a0We need to get busy answering that question and not leave that outcome to chance.\"In his techno-thrillers, Daniel explores the fracture points in modern society, and thinks deeply about how to answer precisely that question. His books are highly recommended.\ufeff",

Hawaii has taken a huge step forward in that direction by harmonizing its state medical privacy laws with HIPAA and other national standards.You can argue (as I do) that HIPAA itself needs some modernization and rethinking in light of the extraordinary benefits that come from sharing patient data (see my paper with +Mike Loukides, +Julie Steele, and COLIN C. HILL, Solving the Wanamaker Problem for Healthcare \u00a0(http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/08/data-health-care.html)), but there's no question that it's a huge step forward when those thinking about healthcare privacy no longer have to navigate multiple levels of conflicting laws.\u00a0Other states should follow Hawaii's lead. \u00a0Take the time to read Ann Waldo's piece here. \u00a0And of course, I'd love your ideas for other areas where government can be refactored.\ufeff",

Like all the others, it points out the intentional, deceptive sophistry of Ferguson's arguments, but then points to the even deeper failure in his thinking. \u00a0He writes:\"But while the fact that Ferguson is trying to trick his readers about the facts of his case might be a reason to be skeptical of the rest of his piece, it\u2019s not the main reason. After all, Ferguson\u2019s careful misdirection is arguably evidence of a quick and agile mind. He might be cheating to strengthen his argument. But that doesn\u2019t mean his argument is wrong.\"\"Rather, the main reason to mistrust Ferguson is that, for years now, his argument has been wrong.\" (Italics mine.)Read the piece to see the devastating flaw that makes everything that Niall Ferguson even more wrong than he appears.\ufeff",

The financial system has been wounded by a flood of so-called innovations that merely promote hyper-rapid trading, market timing and shortsighted corporate maneuvering. Individual investors are being shortchanged, he writes.\"\"Corporate money is flooding into political campaigns. The American retirement system faces a train wreck. America\u2019s fundamental values are threatened. Mr. Bogle remains a dyed-in-the-wool capitalist but says the system has \u201cgotten out of balance,\u201d threatening our entire society.\"I hadn't realized that despite setting up a company that manages nearly 40% of all mutual fund money, Bogle is no billionaire. \u00a0He set up Vanguard to be owned entirely by those who invest through it. \u00a0This guy should be a hero to #ows.\ufeff",

   "content": "Capital Gains Cuts: Why the Ryan Tax Plan Goes in the Exact Wrong DirectionAs The Atlantic points out,\u00a0Mitt Romney would pay 0.82 percent in taxes under the Ryan Plan. \u00a0(Mitt himself pointed that out in the primaries when it was Newt Gingrich trumpeting the plan.) \u00a0And of course, the plan is a non-starter when it comes to funding Federal obligations. \u00a0Unless Romney plans to cut military spending in half, and cut social security to boot, there's nothing left to fund anything else.But the real issue, to me, is the source of the tax cuts: capital gains. We have an economy whose prime dysfunction comes from the fact that financial markets have become a casino. \u00a0The fact that the current tax plan favors capital gains over wages (with a 35% marginal tax on wages, but only 15% on capital gains) helps boost the financial economy rather than the real economy.I haven't done the math on how much additional revenue would be gained, but from the point of view of equity and incentives, I'd leave capital gains rates as they are but greatly extend the time horizon for \"long term\" capital gains. \u00a0(Short term capital gains from financial instruments held under a year are taxed the same as wages (leaving out social security and other taxes added to employment income), but gains for property held longer than a year are considered long term, and taxed at the 15% rate.)I'd set the threshold for long term capital gains at five years (at least). \u00a0There's a big difference between owning a home, or a business, for many many years, and then having a one-time gain that represents a lifetime of investment, and \u00a0holding a stock for a year, and juggling a stock portfolio to hold that stock just long enough to get favorable tax treatment when you sell it. \u00a0The idea that a year is \"long term\" is laughable to anyone who really thinks long term.I'd also tighten down all the loopholes that allow people to avoid paying even capital gains by borrowing against the value of a security. \u00a0 One rich friend remarked that he's never paid taxes. \u00a0He bought a building in Manhattan when he was in college; its value has increased by tens of millions of dollars (perhaps more), which he's taken out as loans against the value of the building. \u00a0The same is done with equity in companies, and a whole class of specialized financial instruments have been created to hedge against the downside risk. \u00a0I'd bet that many titans of industry have bought their yachts with tax-free dollars taken out in just this way.The point is that if we want to rethink the tax system, we need to get beyond simplistic models that cut, cut, cut, and figure out all the places where taxes highlight our wrong-headed social strategies, and fix those problems. \u00a0I'd start by rethinking the incentives that reward the behavior than nearly broke the world economy, rather than doubling down on them, encouraging even more financial sociopathy.The Ryan Plan rewards everything that is wrong with our economy, and the fact that Mitt Romney picked Paul Ryan as a running mate indicates as surely as anything does that Mitt is the wrong guy to tackle today's problems.\ufeff",

He is not imprisoned by the limitations of the \"I\" \u00a0for the viewpoint of direct intuition is that of both \"I\" and \"Not I\". \u00a0Hence he sees that on both sides of every argument there is both right and wrong. He also sees that in the end they are reducible to the same thing, once they are related to the pivot of Tao. When the wise man grasps this pivot, he is in the center of the circle, and there he stands while \"Yes\" and \"No\" pursue each other around the circumference.\" Not bad for 300 B.C\u00a0\"Enjoy your evenings wherever you may be.\"\ufeff",

We're pretty happy with this one, though, and I'd love to see people give it a try. \u00a0Basically, it means you have any computer book you might want at your fingertips - either at work on a second screen or on the road. \u00a0It's much snappier than using the web version on a tablet or phone.There are more details on the Safari blog:\u00a0http://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2012/07/24/android-and-ios-apps-now-available/ \u00a0The primary download page is linked below.\ufeff",

   "content": "The Clothesline Paradox and the Sharing EconomyThis was my keynote yesterday at  #oscon , the O'Reilly Open Source Convention. \u00a0I talk about what's wrong with our economy - the ecosystem failure that occurs when companies think it's OK to take more value out than they create - and contrast that with sharing economies like open source software. \u00a0I use the analogy of \"the Clothesline Paradox\" - Steve Baer's wonderful account of how solar energy is left out of our energy accounting, treated as if it were a tiny slice when in fact it is the root of all - to explore how creative economies create value that they don't capture.I talk about my conversation with Hari Ravichandran of hosting company Endurance International Group, which led to a partnership to study Bluehost customer data to examine the impact of open source software and web hosting on small business (http://oreillynet.com/oreilly/opensource/radarreports/economic-impact-of-open-source.csp?cmp=fb-code-ebooks-open-source-oscon-smb) as an example of how value created but not captured by innovators shows up elsewhere in the economy.I also talk about evidence of economic acceleration coming out of other sharing economies.(P.S. If you just want to look at the slides, a PDF with notes is here:\u00a0http://www.slideshare.net/timoreilly/the-clothesline-paradox-and-the-sharing-economy-pdf-with-notes-13685423 )Let me know what you think.\ufeff",

Seminal paper on moral hazard: LootingThis fantastic quote from the 1996 paper Looting by George Akerlof and Paul Romer describes the economic underpinning (\"moral hazard\") that created our current financial crisis:\"\u2026the normal economics of maximizing economic value is replaced by the topsy-turvy economics of maximizing current extractable value, which tends to drive the firm's economic net worth deeply negative. Once owners have decided they can extract more from a firm by maximizing their present take, any action that allows them to extract more currently will be attractive--even if it causes a large reduction in the true economic net worth of the firm. \u00a0A dollar in increased dividends today is worth a dollar to owners, but a dollar in increased future earnings is worth nothing because future payments accrue to the creditors who will be left holding the bag.\"The paper was a study of several economic crises of the 1980s, but totally nails current problems. \u00a0If only policy-makers had paid attention! \u00a0(They still can!)\u00a0http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=227162\ufeff",

   "content": "Rather than merging Bain and Massachusetts into one campaign, Romney is running away from bothHere's a thoughtful perspective from +Ezra Klein's piece on Romney's campaign dilemma:\"The best-world version of Mitt Romney is running a campaign that embraces creative destruction and outsourcing and buyouts and all the rest of it because these things help our economy become more dynamic. That\u2019s where his business experience at Bain might actually help him understand the economy \u2014 he has seen the costs of firm-level sclerosis and stagnation firsthand. Think something along the lines of this essay by Reihan Salam. The problem is that the candidate running that campaign needs to have a real answer for the workers who are hurt by that dynamism. Part of that answer would need to be a larger safety net \u2014 something akin to Denmark\u2019s \u201cflexicurity\u201d system. But the modern GOP won\u2019t permit Romney to run a campaign that embraces a larger safety net. And so he can\u2019t embrace his own economic experience without appearing cruel.\"The irony is that the candidate who could have squared this circle is\u2026Mitt Romney. He would have been perfect, in fact. As the former CEO of Bain Capital, he would have been credible on the economic argument in a way most politicians simply aren\u2019t. As the first governor to successfully pass and implement a universal health care program in the United States, he would have been credible on the safety net in a way most Republicans simply aren\u2019t. But rather than merging Bain and Massachusetts into one campaign, he\u2019s running from both.\"The whole piece is well worth reading:http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/07/16/a-few-thoughts-on-romney-and-bain/\ufeff",

When a historian of reading gets very lucky, once in a lifetime, she manages to unearth a diary or a letter in which someone describes whether they loved or hated the book they were reading, and what they loved or hated about it. But most of the time you have to make do with a patchwork of contradictory clues.\"I loved the bit showing how Hemingway's praise of Joyce as a writer is contradicted by his copy of Ulysses, in which only the first and last pages were cut.I also loved this bit:\u00a0\"...professional readers ... were hired to read stories aloud to workers in cigar factories in Cuba at the end of the 19th century, while they were rolling cigars. This is, of course, in the days before radio! So the first audiobooks were human beings.\"And this: \"What I argue in my book is that even when books are lying on the shelf, they still mean something.\"Wonderful stuff.\ufeff",

   "content": "The Sad Face of American Business: How Arm & Hammer Laundry Detergent Rips Off Its CustomersRecently, I couldn't find my normal laundry detergent, so I bought the Arm & Hammer brand instead. \u00a0I was immediately struck by the enormous scoop provided in the box. \u00a0Take a look at the photo below.While trumpeting the concentrated power of their detergent, which allows you to \"use 1/3 less\", they provide a scoop that, at minimum, uses 2x the amount needed, and quite possibly, 9x the amount! \u00a0The amount recommended for normal use is shown by a tiny line at the bottom of the scoop. \u00a0(I've put in some detergent - incidentally, equal to a full scoop from my normal detergent, Citra Suds - to help show the location of the line.) For \"large or heavily soiled loads\" they recommend another line about halfway up the scoop. \u00a0There is no recommended amount that calls for a full scoop.This represents nothing less than theft. \u00a0The casual contempt for customers is shocking. \"You won't notice if we rip you off!\"This is one more example of what Umair Haque calls \"thin value\" - the way that companies boost their bottom line without providing real value to customers, or, in this case, by stealing it from them. (Harvard Business Review: http://blogs.hbr.org/haque/2009/07/the_value_every_business_needs.html).It was this kind of thinking that led to the financial crisis, as banks focused relentlessly on profits and their own bonuses rather than on creating real value.(In this regard, I highly recommend the book The Shareholder Value Myth http://www.amazon.com/The-Shareholder-Value-Myth-Shareholders/dp/1605098132, which focuses on how putting corporate profits first in the name of \"shareholder value\" ends up harming not only the public and corporate employees, but shareholders themselves.)P.S. For those commenting, this post isn't really about laundry detergent. It's about a business culture that condones and even encourages deception as a way of boosting profits. I'm interested in hearing about other examples where companies rip off their customers in similar ways, by getting them to use more of a product than they need. Or other ripoffs.I'm on a campaign to get companies thinking more about making money by providing value to customers, and avoiding gimmicks. The banking crisis was all about an economy of gimmicks, but the mindset that brought us those problems is far more widespread. \u00a0It has to change.\ufeff",

   "content": "Facebook, Google, and the mirage of \"engagement\"I've been struck by a host of stories lately with headlines trumpeting the fact that people spend more time online with Facebook sites than at Google. Google, of course, has played into this narrative by positioning themselves as a social alternative to Facebook.\u00a0What's sad to me is that Google used to pride itself on the speed with which it helped you find the information you want, and then get out of the way.\u00a0 \"Time on site\" is a terrible metric for an information utility!When I'm looking for the answer to a question, when I'm looking for directions or my next appointment, or directions to my next appointment, when I'm getting routed to interesting articles that I want to read, Google provides more utility the less time I spend on site.There's a real danger here that Google will fall into the Yahoo!\u00a0 trap, forgetting who they are by pursuing the competition.\u00a0 Yahoo! was a terrific content destination, and lost its way trying to be a search engine.\u00a0 Might Google be doing the same in trying to become a social destination? With a little time to reflect on the Google I/O announcements, I'm disappointed by how many of them were social time wasters rather than real improvements in utility.I do think social should be an important part of Google's strategy, and overall, I'm impressed by the way they are integrating social across all of their products, but my advice for competing with Facebook is to constantly focus on how to make social data more useful - which may mean less time on site - rather than more \"engaging.\"Of course, both Google and Facebook time on site is dwarfed by the \"time on site\" of television, that vast wasteland of passive consumption. That ought to tell us something about the folly of time on site as a metric. I want services that help me get more benefit from less time\u00a0online, not services that take me further and further from time in the real world.\u00a0 This may be why of all the announcements at Google I/O, I'm most excited about Project Glass.\u00a0 While the demo for Glass emphasizes how it can be a powerful vector for social sharing of experiences (that skydive was awesome!), Glass will avoid marginalization (I heard several people refer to it as \"the Segway of 2012\") only by focusing relentlessly on becoming useful rather than becoming engaging.\u00a0 It will need to slip into the background rather than being in the foreground, a tool for enhancing our engagement with the real world rather than our engagement online.\ufeff",

   "content": "First-person Impressions from Today's Supreme Court Decision on HealthcareMy friend and colleague +Ann Waldo\u00a0(an attorney with whom I've worked on some healthcare privacy issues) was able to attend today's Supreme Court decision. \u00a0She shared some first-person impressions via email, and gave me permission to share them more widely here. \u00a0Ann wrote:\"Family and friends, \u00a0here\u2019s a summary of my take on the Supreme Court decision that Doug and I were privileged to attend in person today. \u00a0I\u2019m still pinching myself that we got to be there. \u00a0I sat up front in the Supreme Court Bar section, approximately four feet from retired Justice John Paul Stevens and about 10 feet from the Justices. \u00a0The day was full of formality \u2013 the Deputy Clerk was wearing a morning suit with tails! \u00a0What a pleasure to be there.\u00a0I do realize, of course, that not all of us view the underlying law the same way, and I\u2019m not trying to open a political debate. \u00a0Just sharing with you my impressions of being present on this historic occasionAnn\u00a0First of all, it really was breathtaking just to be there on such an historic day.\u00a0\u00a0The mood in the courtroom was silent but extremely suspenseful. \u00a0Chief Justice Roberts started out by saying in very strong language that the Commerce Clause does NOT permit Congress to compel citizens to buy something they don't want to buy, whether insurance or broccoli. \u00a0He said the Constitution allows the regulation of commerce, but not the compulsion of commerce. \u00a0He went on for about 10 minutes about how the framers of the Constitution would have understood this in a common sense way \u2013 the government simply cannot compel people to buy an unwanted product.I was sitting (in the second row, unbelievably!) along with the Solicitor General\u2019s lawyers, and they all seemed to stop breathing. \u00a0Roberts continued, saying that allowing the mandate as an exercise of regulating commerce would be a vast government overreach, and would fundamentally change the relationship between government and individuals.So \u2013 it really looked like the mandate was dead as a doornail, and my mind was racing ahead to the next logical question - the severability question \u2013 i.e., how much of the law would instantly evaporate. \u00a0I, like most in the room, was listening hard for clues as to how much of the law would disappear (contemplating the massive changes to contracts, payment arrangements, delivery systems, ACOs, performance measures, children\u2019s health, keeping kids under 26 on their parents\u2019 insurance, etc.)But then the Chief Justice suddenly switched gears. \u00a0He said that if a law is unsustainable under one constitutional theory, but supportable under another theory, then it must be upheld. \u00a0He then analytically worked his way to a firm conclusion that the mandate is a tax. \u00a0Even though Congress didn\u2019t call it a tax, it is administered by the IRS, it is collected on 1040s, it is based on income and dependents, and it raises revenue \u2013 it\u2019s a \u00a0tax. \u00a0And, of course, Congress has almost plenary power to enact taxes. \u00a0(I\u2019ve been saying for months that I wish the Democrats had just called it a tax, for then all these lawsuits would have been dismissed summarily.)The bottom line \u2013 a person can choose to decline to buy insurance and pay the tax without breaking any law. \u00a0Thus, it\u2019s not a real mandate; it\u2019s a tax. \u00a0Thus, it\u2019s Constitutional.Roberts did a brilliant job of threading the needle. In my opinion, he showed real leadership by following the law, not politics or his personal views. \u00a0(He even implied he didn\u2019t favor the law.) And by unexpectedly voting with the liberals, he helped undermine the growing perception of the Court\u2019s own partisanship. \u00a0There\u2019s no question that he elevated his own historical position as a powerful Chief Justice.He also threaded the needle on the Medicaid expansion. \u00a0Although he ruled that while the Medicaid expansion as written was overbroad and coercive (which was the first time in history that the federal spending power has been ruled to be so heavy-headed as to be unconstitutionally coercive on the states), he found a way to avoid knocking millions of poor people out of newly eligible care by making the Medicaid expansion essentially optional at the state level.Justice Kennedy delivered a blistering dissent. \u00a0People have been saying he was a swing vote and might vote to uphold the mandate, but no way, that was far from true. \u00a0He was adamant about how the mandate exceeded the government\u2019s powers, and he didn\u2019t buy the argument that it was really a tax. \u00a0Powerful, articulate positions.Justice Ginsburg delivered a strong dissent to the majority decision that the mandate violated the Commerce Clause. \u00a0She said that not buying health insurance is not remotely like not buying vegetables, because individuals who don\u2019t buy insurance and get sick impose substantial costs on taxpayers and other people who pay for insurance, and that slippery slope arguments are absurd.\u00a0A big day, an amazing decision. \u00a0We\u2019ll all have to stay tuned for reactions and next steps. The political battle lines are certainly being hardened already.\u00a0P.S. In case you\u2019re not \u00a0clear on what the contents of this extremely complicated law are, here\u2019s a small summary. \u00a0There\u2019s a lot more too, much of which has to do with overhauling how we improve quality and save money by paying hospitals and clinicians for the quality of their results, rather than the expensive, terribly expensive status quo method of paying for each service ordered. \u00a0But here\u2019s a quick summary of some of the major effects on individuals:\u00a0* Insurance companies no longer have unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny you coverage, or charge women more than men.* Soon, no American will ever again be denied care or charged more due to a pre-existing condition, like cancer or even asthma.* Preventive care will still be covered free of charge by insurance companies--including mammograms for women and wellness visits for seniors.* By August, millions of Americans will receive a rebate because their insurance company spent too much of their premium on administrative costs or CEO bonuses.* 5.3 million seniors will continue to save $600 a year on their prescription drugs.* Efforts to strengthen and protect Medicare by cracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse will remain in place.* 6.6 million young adults will still be able to stay on their family's plan until they're 26.\"\ufeff",

But when anti-tax politicians keep taxes from rising no matter the level of spending, voters want more spending, as they\u2019re not the ones paying for it. The likely outcome of Norquist\u2019s pledge and a continued Republican resistance to deficit-reduction deals that include higher taxes isn\u2019t less federal spending or lower deficits. It\u2019s more federal spending and higher deficits.\"\ufeff",

In government, the pace of progress can feel even slower, measured in evolutionary time and epochs....\"In the context, the arc of the Health Data Initiative (HDI) in the United States might leave some jaded observers with whiplash....On March 10, 2010, the initiative started with 36 people brainstorming in a room. On June 2, 2010, approximately 325 in-person attendees saw 7 health apps demoed at an historic forum in the theater of Institute of Medicine in Washington, D.C, with another 10 apps packed into an expo in the rotunda outside. All of the apps or services used open government data from the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\"In 2012, 242 applications or services that were based upon or use open data were submitted for consideration to third annual \"Health Datapalooza. About 70 health app exhibitors made it to the expo. The conference itself had some 1400 registered attendees, not counting press and staff, and was sold out in advance...\"\ufeff",

This one is a \"must-read.\"Here's one tidbit:\"Address scarcity contributes to be a strange attractor that deformed the logic of the Internet at scale and helped guarantee the cloud would become the primary architecture. When Vint and his colleagues chose that 32-bit address space they thought they were just making a simple engineering tradeoff based on a seemingly predictable future. But it turns out they were adding a bit of dark matter to our Internet cosmos, perhaps just enough to shift the whole thing from open and expanding to closed and collapsing. Address scarcity added to the gravitational force of centralization and control.\"\ufeff",

A successful entrepreneur and innovator, Rodney Mullen is widely considered the most influential street skater in history, inventing most of the tricks used today. By the time he was 23, Mullen had already set new milestones for skateboarding winning 35 out of 36 freestyle competitions. He studied engineering at the University of Florida before co-founding World Industries, the largest skate company of the 90's, which was acquired for more than $20m. He continues to skate, innovate, and design some 30 years after he won his first world championship at the age of 11. Mullen spends his spare time thinking about open source communities, hacking the urban terrain, and transforming the mundane into something new. He'll be featured in the upcoming documentary, \"The Bones Brigade: An Autobiography.\"",

What an inspiring end to the talk!P.S. This was an awesome piece to watch on my birthday, since Rodney's closing remarks totally echo how I think about my own work.Thanks, +Krisztina Holly\u00a0for introducing me to Rodney!\ufeff",

Why? Because smartphones (and tablets) are tightly controlled, \"tethered\" appliances. You may think that you own your shiny new iPhone or iPad, for example. But in fact an invisible chain stretches from it all the way back to Apple's corporate HQ in California. Nothing, but nothing, goes on your iDevice that hasn't been approved by Apple.\"\"And even if you're not an Apple fanboy and sport an Android-powered mobile device, there is still the problem that your access to the internet is regulated by a company \u2013 your mobile network provider \u2013 which is free not just to charge prohibitively for access but also to decide what you can access and what you can't.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "Why do people keep blaming deficits on Obama Rather than Bush?Another article making the point that Obama ought to be making: the deficit is the result of out-of-control spending and tax-cutting under GW Bush. A few tidbits:\"According to Nutting\u2019s calculations, spending has grown only 1.4 percent per year under Obama \u2013 one-fifth the rate under Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. Following is a chart accompanying the article. [Go to the original article to see the chart]\"...I don\u2019t want to get into the nitty-gritty of whether to allocate all spending in fiscal year 2009 to Bush or Obama. I just want to note that the [incoming] president has very little control over the budget one way or another; the vast bulk of spending is baked in the cake the day he takes office and changes can only be made incrementally and over time.\"This fact is illustrated by looking at CBO\u2019s last spending projection of the Bush administration, which was issued on January 8, 2009 \u2013 2 weeks before Obama took office and containing no Obama initiatives. It shows that spending was projected to rise to 24.9 percent of GDP in 2009 under laws that Obama inherited \u2013 almost exactly what it ended up being.\"...\"Another thing that is clear from the CBO data is that the budget deficit is as much the result of lower taxes as higher spending. Revenues fell from 17.5 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2008 to 14.9 percent in 2009 and 2010, rising to just 15.4 percent in 2011 and 15.8 percent this year. Had revenues stayed at their 2008 level, combined federal deficits would have been $1.3 trillion smaller since 2008.\"And this estimate actually understates the extent to which Bush\u2019s policies devastated the government\u2019s revenue-raising capacity. In the postwar era, federal revenues have averaged 18.5 percent of GDP. They averaged 18.2 percent during Ronald Reagan\u2019s 8 years and 19 percent under Bill Clinton\u2019s 8 years, but 17.6 percent during George W. Bush\u2019s 8 years and just 15.2 percent for Obama\u2019s 4 years thus far.\"_At a minimum, this puts a lie to the ideas that we are overtaxed, that Obama has raised taxes, or that low taxes stimulate growth._\" [Italics mine]Please do read the entire article before commenting! Doing so will hopefully lead to more substantial discussion.\ufeff",

While I think he's wrong about the importance of the internet as an innovation, I think that's really just a semantic difference. While I think that the internet is world-changing technology (far more important than the flying cars of his disparaging quote \"\u201cWe wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters\u201d)  I too think of most of the consumer internet as trivial, and most tech entrepreneurs not reaching high enough. I also don't share his libertarian ideals, but I do think society needs a major makeover.  But regardless, he's a mind worth engaging with, and this is a great profile.  It is far-reaching, and has many worthwhile insights.I'd love to debate my idea of \"government as a platform\" with him - the notion that the best way to shrink the size of government is to introduce the idea that government should provide fewer citizen-facing services, but should instead consciously provide infrastructure only, with APIs and standards that let the private sector deliver citizen facing services.  (This is what happened with weather data, for example, and non-military use of GPS, and even public transit and GTFS; it could happen with future smart city initiatives, with health care, with financial services regulation, and many other areas.)  I suspect the debate would sharpen my ideas.\ufeff",

   "content": "Another sad commentary on how banks have lost their wayThis New York Times article about the drying up of credit to small business as regional savings banks are bought up by big banks trying to repair their capital base after what were effectively gambling losses from their investment banking divisions reminds us why banks need to be regulated, and is once again a reminder that the notion that the only obligation of business is to make a profit is \"the big lie\" of capitalism.Banks exist to provide a service to the market. They exist in the matrix of society - providing a haven for savings, which they they monetize by lending out to businesses and individuals who are creating new value.  When this virtuous circle is broken because banks, in pursuit of excess profits, turn to \"investment banking\", the virtuous cycle is broken.  Gambling with investment capital is a reasonable thing to do - I do it myself as a venture capitalist with O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures. But it's one thing to do it with capital that is provided by customers for that purpose, and another to do it with capital that was accumulated for the purpose of making loans.We need more banks that remember what banks are for.  And it seems to do that, we need regulation to separate traditional banking from investment banking. (P.S. I have strong feelings on this subject, because O'Reilly Media was nearly put out of business by our bank after the dot com bust in 2001. Just when we needed more credit after our business shrank by 25% in one year after growing 15-20% a year for a decade, they tightened it, almost to the point of killing us.)\ufeff",

She decided to test her own breast milk and shipped a sample to a lab in Germany. What came back surprised her. Trace amounts of pesticides, dioxin and a jet fuel ingredient \u2014 as well as high to average levels of flame retardants \u2014 were all found in her breast milk. How could something like this happen?\"When you read the original piece about flame retardants and realize that those flame retardants were promoted by tobacco companies because people were dying from smoking in bed, you see once again the horrible downstream effects of the failure of business morality in pursuit of profit.  Here's the original story on flame retardants:http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/opinion/sunday/kristof-are-you-safe-on-that-sofa.html?src=recgFrom that story:\"This campaign season, you\u2019ll hear fervent denunciations of \u201cburdensome government regulation.\u201d When you do, think of the other side of the story: your home is filled with toxic flame retardants that serve no higher purpose than enriching three companies.

   "content": "Financial Markets do not equal \"The Market\"One of the most eye-opening concepts for me recently was one from Bill Janeway's forthcoming book Doing Capitalism.  Most of us naively accept the formulation that the economy is a two-player game, made up of \"the free market\" and government, which keeps it in check.  Bill makes an incredibly important distinction between the market consisting of the real exchange of goods and services, and financial capital, which, like the state, sometimes benefits the market, and sometimes damages it.  It's not a two-player game, it's a three-player game, as the current financial crisis has demonstrated.Read this +Paul Krugman op-ed with this framework in mind, and it will be much more compelling even to those who normally will be tempted to think of financial capital and \"the market\" as one and the same.Here is the bit worth pondering, while trying in your mind to separate financial capital from the real market economy:\"...we\u2019ve been hearing a lot from Wall Street and its reliable defenders \u2014 a tale in which the incredible damage runaway finance inflicted on the U.S. economy gets flushed down the memory hole, and financiers instead become the heroes who saved America.\"Once upon a time, this fairy tale tells us, America was a land of lazy managers and slacker workers. Productivity languished, and American industry was fading away in the face of foreign competition.\"Then square-jawed, tough-minded buyout kings like Mitt Romney and the fictional Gordon Gekko came to the rescue, imposing financial and work discipline. Sure, some people didn\u2019t like it, and, sure, they made a lot of money for themselves along the way. But the result was a great economic revival, whose benefits trickled down to everyone.\"You can see why Wall Street likes this story. But none of it \u2014 except the bit about the Gekkos and the Romneys making lots of money \u2014 is true.\"For the alleged productivity surge never actually happened. In fact, overall business productivity in America grew faster in the postwar generation, an era in which banks were tightly regulated and private equity barely existed, than it has since our political system decided that greed was good.\"What about international competition? We now think of America as a nation doomed to perpetual trade deficits, but it was not always thus. From the 1950s through the 1970s, we generally had more or less balanced trade, exporting about as much as we imported. The big trade deficits only started in the Reagan years, that is, during the era of runaway finance.\"And what about that trickle-down? It never took place. There have been significant productivity gains these past three decades, although not on the scale that Wall Street\u2019s self-serving legend would have you believe. However, only a small part of those gains got passed on to American workers.\"So, no, financial wheeling and dealing did not do wonders for the American economy, and there are real questions about why, exactly, the wheeler-dealers have made so much money while generating such dubious results.\"\ufeff",

Countries like Australia, Estonia, Ireland and Switzerland, which tend to favor low taxes and a small state, have government revenue that accounts for more of GDP than it does in the United States.\"\"The Internal Revenue Service is also relatively restrained compared with recent U.S. history. In 1945, at the close of World War Two, federal tax receipts were 20.4 percent of GDP (expenditures, by the way, were 41.9 percent, putting the federal budget deficit at 21.5 percent, compared with 8.7 percent in 2011). In 1952, the year the Republican Dwight Eisenhower was elected president, federal government revenue was 19 percent of GDP. In 1988, the last year of Ronald Reagan\u2019s transformational conservative presidency, the federal tax take was 18.2 percent of GDP.\"\"Compare those figures with that of today, when a Democrat is in the White House, nearly half of Americans think their taxes are too high, and both parties are promising to keep taxes low for all, or, in the case of the Democrats, 99 percent of Americans. In 2011, government revenue was 15.4 percent of GDP, lower than it was at any time during the Eisenhower or Reagan eras. Like anorexics, who think they are grossly fat when they are very thin, the American body politic is suffering from a national version of body dysmorphia, with nearly half the country believing taxes are high, when they are comparatively and historically low.\"Those low revenues (also known as low taxes) is a major reason the deficit is so high.\ufeff",

And the notion of the government putting out public service propaganda films and posters for Americans wouldn't go over too well today, but it does strike me that the urgent call to public action around big, common issues is something we could use more of. (\"Friends don't let friends drive drunk\" is a modern example, but you could imagine many useful examples.)Would love to hear thoughts both on current examples that are hiding in plain sight and on areas where some public encouragement might help with collective action and sentiment.\ufeff",

I have swam with 3,500lb sharks and tickled their bellies, ridden on their backs, and petted them. I have learned to love them and see them much like folks see family dogs. They are nothing but animals and most of the time, harmless. More folks die from family dog attacks than white shark attacks.\"We must leave our preconceived notions behind us and grow up! The only true monsters are men. Over 73 million sharks are killed just for shark-fin soup. That is over 200,000 per day! Last month a shark I loved for 20 years was murdered for her fins and jaws. Her 60-year long life ended for $1,800. Her 3,000lb body rots on a Baja beach, and I miss her.\"When I was in Baja recently, I too was horrified to see the number of sharks killed for their fins and left on the beach. Sad.\ufeff",

   "content": "Loved Daniel Suarez' forthcoming book, Kill DecisionI had the privilege of getting an advance reading copy of +Daniel Suarez' new book, Kill Decision.  Like his previous books, Daemon and Freedom, it includes a terrific mix of thrills and mayhem, big ideas, and well-founded technological and social speculation.  This is the kind of mind-expanding novel that uses entertainment to make powerful, important points about alarming current trends; the novel as cautionary tale has rarely been better executed.Kill Decision focuses on the very real possibility of drone warfare, carried out by autonomous swarming drones independent of human supervision.  But it's not just the drones that operate without supervision: the book is all too accurate in its depiction of a profit-driven corporate military-industrial complex that feeds on society, manipulating public opinion to sell wars that we don't need in order to fund massive new military spending.To anyone who's watched the revolving-door fortunes made from the security theater carried out by the Transportation Security Administration (link), the notion of defense contractors managing threat levels to drive weapons appropriations makes all too much sense.  If you doubt, Suarez includes a bibliography of non-fiction books that explore and document this same point.As one of the characters, entomologist and swarm intelligence expert Linda McKinney, notes, \"Her childhood experiences had taught her one thing above all: that the world was not filled with danger. Danger was there sometimes, but it wasn't the norm.  The common thread she'd found in every culture was that the majority of people were decent and simply wanted to raise their children in peace. That basic desire was what linked us all.\"Which was why America's recent, all-encompassing fear puzzled McKinney. She felt like someone who'd returned from a long, inspiring journey only to discover that an old friend had gone crazy-paranoid. She barely recognized what America had become.\"The notion that this fear is driven not just by external enemies (and the book doesn't deny that real enemies and real threats exist) but by those who profit by amplifying it runs like a current through this book, as does the notion that it is a core of decent people who recognize this problem and stand up to fight it.Most alarming is the book's realistic depiction of just how much of our national security has been outsourced to companies with a profit interest that may not align with our own national best interest. While many might think this is overdrawn (and perhaps it is, in an \"if this goes on\" way), it's worth reminding people that this is indeed how Rome fell. Unless you've read more deeply in Roman history than most, you imagine a horde of barbarians overrunning the empire. In fact, Rome had outsourced its security to these barbarians: Odoacer, the \"barbarian\" who ended the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, had been enrolled as a Roman general.  (Alaric the Goth, who sacked Rome in 410 AD, was also in the pay of Rome at the time.  He sacked Rome when the coffers were empty and the empire was no longer able to pay.)There are fascinating bits of science and technology throughout the book, from myrmecology (the study of ants), the intelligence level of ravens, to social media monitoring (and sockpuppetry) for surveillance and manipulation, as well as how easy it is to track and spoof cell phones.  Most of these are explained with a fair degree of accuracy and a great deal of plausibility.  And anyone who's seen the swarming drones demo from TED [link] can easily understand just how near-future swarming drones might be.There's a lot of social insight and discussion as well. There's one bit about the relationship between modes of government and modes of warfare that I'm so tempted to quote because of its deep insight, but which is too close to heart of the book's argument to make me want it to stand alone.I love the deep, humane sensibility that underlies Suarez' thinking. He holds great debates between some of the characters about what makes people tick, and the voice that runs through the book is admonitory but fundamentally affirming of human goodness.To one who argues that it's all about survival of the fittest, McKinney replies:\"There is a great deal more to evolutionary biology than survival of the fittest -- although that's all that anyone seems to remember. One of Darwin's contemporaries was Alfred Russell Wallace, who had even more profound lessons about evolution -- that humans are social creatures. That we co-evolve with other species as part of a fabric of interwoven and interdependent life forms. The world isn't entirely about competition and dominance. And species that cooperate with others succeed better than those who do not. That's what civilization is, cooperation.\"The book is a great read, with appealing characters, non-stop action, and a great story. It's not as mind-blowing as Daemon, but it's a lot closer to reality. Highly recommended. Actually, I'd go further and put it in the \"must read\" pile.\ufeff",

   "content": "Reflections on PopVox, and What It Helps Me See About CongressOne of the things that keeps people from being involved in the day-to-day of politics (rather than just elections) is that if you aren't a lobbyist, it's just too tough to keep up with all the bills that you care about. +POPVOX is working to change that. One of their latest features is the \"single-issue spotlight,\" where they identify a cluster of bills of interest to a subset of their users who have expressed interest in similar bills, and keep them up to date on related legislation. The single issue spotlight on bills related to Autism Awareness Month and Tourette's Awareness Month that I link to below is an example.This is the beginning of PopVox's vision of the \"Civic Network\" (a social network that expresses the common concerns of various groups of citizens).The other thing it makes clear is just how dysfunctional Congress is. Seeing the huge number of bills on these few issues makes me realize how little coordination there is among members of Congress, how much overlap there is in their activities, and how much of what they do is driven by short-term-thinking. (Sorry for the cynicism.) All of these bills no doubt intend to do some good, but it's hard to imagine that this much activity just as we have \"Autism Awareness Month\" and \"Tourette's Awareness Month\" is more than showboating.I like to talk about \"government as a platform\", but this makes Congress look a lot more like SourceForge than like Apple. Lots of random code put up for special purposes, only some of which is useful. But the difference here is that when these things pass, we all have to download them, rather than just getting to choose the good stuff. Wouldn't it be awesome to have a Steve Jobs at the head of Congress who could send bills back for rework until they added up to something simple, beautiful and effective.All that being said, we don't have a Steve Jobs running Congress, and our system doesn't work that way. So what I'm really liking about PopVox is that it puts us (\"we, the people\") in that role. If we can make it easier to keep track of what Congress is actually doing, and have more people care about it, we'll eventually be able to rein in the excess, and let Congress know more effectively what we really want from them: a government that works.\ufeff",

   "content": "SMS is 20 years old today: an unheralded technology success for government standardizationThis Guardian piece traces the history and importance of SMS, the technology that doesn't get the love that the web gets as a world-changing technology, but has such a huge impact. But the thing that really caught my eye in the story was the following:\"The story of GSM and SMS has interesting lessons for technology policy. GSM came about largely because of Europe-wide governmental action: the establishment of a continent-wide technical standard effectively created an enormous industry and gave Europe a significant lead in mobile telephony. So the right-wing mantra that governments should keep their noses out of technology policy and leave it to the market is sometimes wrong.\"Second, the story of SMS shows that the people who effectively invent a technology \u2013 in the sense of determining its use and making it viable \u2013 are not so much the engineers who design it as the consumers who discover what it's really for. The telephone was originally conceived as a broadcast medium, whereas radio was conceived as a point-to-point medium. Exactly the opposite turned out to be true in both cases. And it was teenagers who 'invented' SMS.\"In other words, SMS turns out to be another great example of what I've called \"government as a platform.\" Government provided, in this case, the impetus for telephony that crossed national borders. And the fact that the US for so long lagged behind in mobile is an example of what it meant to be left out of that platform.\ufeff",

   "content": "Target, Unhappy With Being an Amazon Showroom, Will Stop Selling KindlesMaybe it doesn't matter in the end to the Amazon steamroller, but this seems like a good case of \"what goes around comes around\".From the article:\"Like other big retailers, Target has been trying to figure out how tostop Amazon shoppers from visiting Target stores to check outproducts, and then buy them online from Amazon. It is a practiceencouraged by Amazon; over the Christmas holiday, for example, thecompany offered a promotion on its Price Check app that gave shoppers5 percent off any item scanned at a store.\"Now that retailers like Target are aware of this so-calledshowrooming, carrying Amazon\u2019s Kindle is a little \u201clike Starbucksselling Dunkin\u2019 Donuts gift certificates,\u201d said Michael Norris, asenior analyst for Simba Information.\"IMO, it's a natural competitive pressure for companies to face internet comparison shopping by consumers. But it's entirely another for Amazon to actually run promotions encouraging them to shop in other people's stores, but then buy on Amazon, as they did last Christmas.If you think about it the right way, it's a kind of \"theft of service.\" The retailer with the showroom is in a tacit exchange with the customer: We will provide you with this amenity - the chance for you to lay your hands on the goods and take a look at them - in exchange for the chance to sell them to you.As I wrote in my 2003 piece, \"Buy where you shop\" (http://tim.oreilly.com/articles/buy_where_shop.html), if consumers break this bargain, they ultimately won't have the showroom to go to. That's short sighted. But when one retailer, like Amazon, urges customers to use a service funded by a competitor but not to pay for it, that's sleazy, especially when that other retailer is a partner.I always think of something Walt Mossberg once told me he'd said to Microsoft: \"If you guys would dial back the greed just 5%, everyone wouldn't hate you so much.\"It's that last extra squeeze that makes people turn on you.  Right now, Amazon is still a darling of consumers (including me), but if their business practices are any indicator, their future is less rosy.I have such mixed feelings about Amazon, Jekyll and Hyde that they are, incredible visionary value creator and hyper-competitive boot-heel in the face \"partner.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "Optimizing for the common good This article by 2011 Code for America fellow +joel mahoney (@joelmahoney) starts out as the story an an app he wrote last year called DiscoverBPS (Boston Public Schools), then goes on to outline how technology can change how government works in fundamental ways.  I love his observation:\"DiscoverBPS uses a home address and grade level to generate a personalized list of schools, and uses an open-source tool called pgRouting to display the student's walk zone (also known as a \"walkshed\") on a map. This gives parents a transparent view of their options, and gave the School Department its first accurate representation of the walk zone policy....\"So what is the significance of this improvement? First of all, the school department had a great idea; one that promised to strengthen neighborhood communities and reduce school bus transportation costs. _Without an appropriate mode of measurement, however, they were unable to accurately implement the policy. It wasn't until DiscoverBPS -- with its advanced routing and mapping technologies -- that the policy became truly viable. Policies, like laws, are effective only if they're enforceable, and enforcement relies on the ability to measure, to quantify._\" [emphasis mine]Joel goes on to give an awesome example of what I've been calling \"algorithmic regulation\":\"the M25 highway in England uses radar guns, video cameras, and magnetic sensors -- not simply to catch speeding motorists, but to dynamically adjust speed limit signs in response to changing driving conditions. The system can measure the shockwave from an accident, for example, and automatically reduce upstream speed limits to prevent an accordion effect of stop-and-go traffic. A law that was once static -- a stationary speed limit sign -- is transformed into something dynamic and adaptive. And to what end? To improve overall throughput and safety on the highway, i.e. to automatically advance the common good. Tim O'Reilly refers to this as \"algorithmic regulation.\"\ufeff",

Some highlights:\"* 15% would give up their car for an entire year to be able to keep their tablet; that would equate to 45 million fewer cars on the road, meaning less traffic and a whopping 270 million tons fewer greenhouse gases (CO2) emitted per year.* Tablets are now the second most fought over device in the living room, just behind desktops/laptops, and ahead of TV remotes.* A third of men frequently take their tablet to the bathroom. 40% of women never take the tablet to the bathroom.* A quarter of women are happy to give up sex (25%) to keep their tablet. As for men? Only half as many men would give up sex (13%).* The tablet is the go-to wind-down device: 91% use their tablet in bed.\"Some reactions:  I wonder how many of those people who'd give up cars are living in urban areas and are thinking about dropping their car anyway.  (With services like zipcar and relayrides, it's increasingly easy to do without one.)  I'm sorry to hear so many people have bad sex lives.

Small and medium-size banks, after all, are at a competitive disadvantage to the big guys, so they are less able to lend to companies of modest size, which do so much of the hiring in this country.\u201cThe policy has favored large global banks and disfavored small and medium-sized banks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not surprised that real economic and job growth that should come from these enterprises is still lacking.

   "content": "How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Taxes Around the Globe: Some Personal ReflectionsIf someone asked you how much Apple paid on $34.2 Billion in profits, what would you guess?  Especially if you listen regularly to the right-wing rhetoric about how tax burden is unsupportable, how jobs are being destroyed because of excessive taxes, and how companies are being made uncompetitive by their tax burden?  How much?$9 billion?  $10 billion?  Nah.  It's $3.3 billion, or a tax rate of about 9.8%.  The actual figure is likely even lower, since \"Apple does not disclose what portion of those payments was in the United States, or what portion is assigned to previous or future years.\"  Apple, of course, is not the only one. This front page article in today's New York Times singles out Apple as an example both because Apple is now about to become the most profitable company ever, and is one of the most aggressive in tax avoidance. But the article isn't unfair to Apple.  It talks about a culture of tax avoidance throughout corporate America, and in particular, at high tech firms, which have the biggest opportunities for tax avoidance because digital goods and \"intellectual property\" can more easily be made to appear to belong to subsidiaries in low or no-tax countries.Big companies have armies and lawyers who outfox tax collectors by taking advantage of a patchwork of conflicting tax regimes around the world.  For example:\"Apple, for instance, was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed them to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes, according to former executives. Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the \u201cDouble Irish With a Dutch Sandwich,\u201d which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean. Today, that tactic is used by hundreds of other corporations \u2014 some of which directly imitated Apple\u2019s methods, say accountants at those companies.\"There's an expanded explanation of the Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich later in the story.  But this line gives one taste:  \"In 2004, Ireland, a nation of less than 5 million, was home to more than one-third of Apple\u2019s worldwide revenues, according to company filings.\"I highly recommend this story.  It is truly eye-opening.  I'm going to post a couple of the graphs from the story separately (Note to G+ - do allow embedded graphics and multiple links! With a storify-like interface, you could do this super-easily without making people need to know HTML.)  The bar graph that shows Apple's growing profits versus their relatively static taxes is here:  http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2012/04/29/technology/29appletax-hp-graphic.html?ref=businessAlas, it is a pale shadow of the version in the print edition, which is vertical rather than horizontal, and uses a scale that takes up 3/4 of the front page. Truly eye-opening.This graph,http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/28/business/Shrinking-Corporate-Tax-Rates.html?ref=business shows that the problem is not limited to Apple. As corporate profits have soared, the amount paid in taxes across the board has remained fairly flat.  Clearly, the tax collectors are falling further and further behind the experts at tax avoidance.But to my promised personal reflectionsI can already imagine the comments of the libertarians and anti-tax advocates in the comments on this post.  \"Avoiding taxes is just keeping more of the hard-earned wealth you've created by being productive and successful.\"But I'd like to suggest a thought experiment.  Imagine that you and a large group of friends, or an extended family, decide to hold a reunion or big party that requires renting a space and some real expenses.  You agree to share the expenses equally.  Then one of you says, \"I'm getting us a discount on the hotel from my friend, so I shouldn't have to pay my share.\"  Another two or three say, \"I'm helping with the catering, so I shouldn't have to pay.\"  Another:  \"I'm willing to act as designated driver, so I shouldn't have to pay.\"  Each time, you think, \"Yeah, that's reasonable.\"But before long, things get dicey.  Three more people fail to send in their promised check for the deposit despite repeat nagging. The ten people who are left on the hook for the expenses say, \"This is too much.  We can't afford it.\"  So you start by letting a couple of your friends, who you know are really hard up for money, off the hook.  Oh sh*t, the problem just got worse for the remaining people, who now have to shoulder a bigger and bigger part of the cost (or put it on a credit card and hope that they will one day be able to pay it back.)Somewhere along the line, you realize that you just can't afford the great party that you'd all had your hearts set on.  You have a choice:  You can scale back.  Or you can stop accepting all the special reasons why one friend or another shouldn't have to pay, share the costs as originally planned, and make it affordable by all working together.Sometimes cutting back is the right choice. But sometimes, working together, we can do things that are wonderful, that none of us could do alone.Put it in the context of your family.  Wouldn't those of you who had more resources support those who didn't?  Wouldn't you shoulder more of the burden?  You're well off.   Your brother or cousin is not.  They can't afford to make it to the family reunion, but you love them dearly.  Would you help?I can imagine the libertarians and anti-taxers again:  \"But that's your choice. The problem is that government has a monopoly on force, and makes us do this against our will.\"Hold on:  You all made an agreement in the beginning to hold this party.  Then some of you decided you wanted to opt out of paying for it.It's a bit more complicated than that, of course, because it was our ancestors who decided to hold the party, and agreed over time on how to split the costs, and a bunch of wasteful cousins ran up the tab.  But we're still a family, we still care about each other, and we want to do right for each other.  So we work it out, and try to be fair, and to the extent we can, generous.That's how it is, folks.  We can be a happy family, who look after each other and create joy and possibility through being together, or one that chooses to go our separate ways, and leaves a lot of happiness on the table.P.S.  I come from a large, close, and generous family.  I grew up in a household where my father borrowed money to meet his charitable obligations.  When my company nearly went under in 1985, my mother saved it with a loan of a large percentage of her liquid assets, with the only stipulation being that she'd ask for it back when I didn't need it any more, and someone else did.  That became known in the family as a \"mammy loan.\"  A few years later, that same money helped my brother to buy a house.  As I became more successful, I paid it forward to other family members as well.I look at families that are successful.  They love and take care of each other, and are repaid in ways that make everyone happier. I look at families that are unsuccessful.  Everyone looks after number one, and they gradually drift apart.I know which kind of family I want.  And I want my country to work the same way.\ufeff",

And how, in an alternate world, this track could be marked with a big \"No Trespassing\" sign.When we think about government, it's so easy to focus on what's wrong: too much intrusive regulation, outrageous costs perpetrated by unscrupulous contractors and feckless bureaucrats, vicious politics driven by party rather than public interest. But what about what's right? We have roads that generally take us whereever we want to go, water, power and communications in even the poorest areas, and public amenities like parks and schools that, for all their faults, are available to all rather than, as only a few hundred years ago, only to the children of the rich.I'm grateful for how much public spirit there has been in the shaping of our society, and how much is still right and good about that shaping.\ufeff",

For example, I wrote my Frank Herbert book in 1978, and didn't put it online till over 20 years later, when it was out of print, with no one at the publisher who would respond to me, making it a classic \"orphan work.\"Also, Ed Krol wrote The Whole Internet User's Guide and Catalog, though +Mike Loukides wrote the chapter about the World Wide Web at the last minute, just as the book was going to press, after +Dale Dougherty brought the web to our attention. (There were only about 200 websites at the time, so it was under most people's radar.  So I'm really proud that we did this.)  At any rate, O'Reilly & Associates (now O'Reilly Media) just published the book. We didn't write it, with the exception of that chapter.  (And of course, as the editor, Mike's hands were on every page.)Government as a Platform is not a book.  It's a chapter in the book Open Government.\ufeff",

It shows how constituents view their positions. Eg to check out how well Barbara Boxer aligns with her constituents who have weight in on Popvox, see http://bit.ly/IQpFS5 Click on the heading \"Co-sponsored\" and you'll see PIPA right at the top of the list, where only 3% of her constituents agreed with her position.Sometimes the number of users who have weighed in on a particular bill is too small to be meaningful, but the system will get better over time.One of the things that Popvox does really well is to help Members of Congress understand sentiment from their district (rather than sentiment overall).  When I was visiting with congressional staff early in the social media revolution, this was a frequent complaint:  \"we don't really take feedback from social media into account because we don't know who's actually from our district.\"  Popvox fixes that.(Disclaimer:  I am an investor and an adviser in Popvox.  But I'm not praising it for those reasons. Rather, I'm an investor and adviser because I believe Popvox is a service that really needs to exist!)\ufeff",

   "content": "More thoughts on the regulatory aspects of government as a platformWhen I've written about government as a platform, I've focused on examples like GPS, the weather service, open data, and the national highway system (or in earlier centuries, the post office), but I think President Obama is right, in the quote I cited yesterday, to also talk about the regulatory aspects of government as a platform. (In case you didn't read the previous post https://plus.google.com/107033731246200681024/posts/Yv4hXyUMxPJ, he said: \"...when you look at the history of how we became an economic superpower, that rugged individualism and private-sector dynamism was always coupled with government creating a platform so that everybody could succeed so that consumers weren't taken advantage of, so that the byproducts of capitalism, like pollution or worker injuries, were regulated. Creating that social safety net has not made us weaker \u2013 it's made us stronger. It liberated people to say, \"I can move to another state, but if I don't find a job right away, my kids aren't going to go hungry. I can start a business, but if it doesn't work out, I'm going to be able to land on my feet.\" Making those kinds of commitments to each other \u2013 to create safety nets, to invest in infrastructure and schools and basic research \u2013 is just like our collective investment in national security or fire departments or police. It has facilitated the kind of risk-taking that has made our economy so dynamic. This is what it means for us to live in a thriving, modern democracy.\")Let's consider some contemporary technology platforms and their regulatory aspects:* Without anti-spam regulation by your ISP, your email inbox would be completely unusable. * Without search quality regulation by search engines, search results would be completely unusable.* Without regulation of what apps appear in the iPhone app store, you'd be subject to many more fraudulent apps than you find today.* Without credit card fraud detection (and rules requiring that you aren't liable for said fraud, which incentivizes the credit card companies to find it first), you'd still be using cash.* Without regulation of the fuel-air mix, your car engine wouldn't work.* Without regulation (error checking, garbage collection, resource allocation), no application or operating system would work.Note also that none of these systems work perfectly, yet we don't find ourselves saying \"Just get rid of regulation, and things would be just fine!\" Yet that's what so many people seem to say about government.The point isn't to get rid of regulation. It's to make it work better.And given the scope and scale of society today, it's useful to think of the government we have today as an operating system or an application that is badly out of date, with lots of accumulated cruft. You don't say \"we don't need operating systems.\" You say \"this operating system needs an update.\"And our regulatory system is definitely in need of an update. It operates by 20th century rules, or in some cases, even 19th century rules, when trying to manage a 21st century world.\ufeff",

   "content": "President Obama says the magic words: government creating a platformIt's really nice to see President Obama using the metaphor of government as a platform. Here's the money quote in the Rolling Stone interview:\"The free market is the greatest generator of wealth in history. I'm a firm believer in the free market, and the capacity of Americans to start a business, pursue their dreams and strike it rich. But when you look at the history of how we became an economic superpower, that rugged individualism and private-sector dynamism was always coupled with government creating a platform so that everybody could succeed...\"Thinking of government as platform rather than an end-to-end solution provider is a way to resolve the conflict between left and right in politics. It's clear that government is too big, and yet the problems that we need to solve collectively are still bigger. The notion of government as a platform focuses government on doing the things that only government can do, building key infrastructure that will catalyze the private sector.We saw this platform dynamic with smartphones. Before the iPhone, smart phones worked a lot like government procurement. The manufacturers and the carriers got together in a back room and figured out what they thought people needed. Phones came with 20 or 30 apps. But when Apple figured out how to turn the phone into a platform, there were hundreds of thousands of apps delivering ideas that no one at Apple had imagined.Examples of government as a platform include the Interstate Highway System, GPS, and open data. (For example, at the local level, governments opening up transit data feeds enables transit data in google maps or 3rd party smartphone apps far more effectively than if governments tried to build all these apps themselves.)But I think President Obama is right when he also points to social safety nets as part of government acting as a platform.  Continuing the quotation above, he says:\"But when you look at the history of how we became an economic superpower, that rugged individualism and private-sector dynamism was always coupled with government creating a platform so that everybody could succeed so that consumers weren't taken advantage of, so that the byproducts of capitalism, like pollution or worker injuries, were regulated. Creating that social safety net has not made us weaker \u2013 it's made us stronger. It liberated people to say, \"I can move to another state, but if I don't find a job right away, my kids aren't going to go hungry. I can start a business, but if it doesn't work out, I'm going to be able to land on my feet.\" Making those kinds of commitments to each other \u2013 to create safety nets, to invest in infrastructure and schools and basic research \u2013 is just like our collective investment in national security or fire departments or police. It has facilitated the kind of risk-taking that has made our economy so dynamic. This is what it means for us to live in a thriving, modern democracy.\"I think that's right.  But it's important to design these safety nets so that they are enablers rather than replacements for private sector activity. Designing effective platforms is hard, and there's a history all through the computer industry of platform providers choking off innovation on the platform by doing too much.What Lao Tzu said about government 2500 years ago still stands:  \"When the best leader leads, the people say 'We did it ourselves.'\"\ufeff",

   "content": "Gradually, then suddenlyOn a mailing list about the future of publishing, +Mike Shatzkin used a fabulous line, \"gradually then suddenly,\" which describes the way that many seemingly chaotic processes progress, from collapsing sandpiles to forest fires to industry transformations, like the one that we're now facing with print to ebooks.Eric Hellman traced it back to Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. The full quote:\u201cHow did you go bankrupt?\" \"Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly.\u201d I love lines from literature that crystallize a notion, and then become tools in your mental toolbox. This is one of those. Keep it handy, because you're going to see \"gradually, then suddenly\" processes happen increasingly in the next few decades, not just in technology and in industries transformed by technology, but in global issues like climate change, and in politics.It occurs to me that our investment thesis at OATV (O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures) might be summed up by this quote. We look for entrepreneurs that are on the forefront of industries that are at that \"gradually, then suddenly\" tipping point, where most of the world doesn't yet realize what a big transformation is in store, and where our investment can help transition from \"gradually\" to \"suddenly.\"This has been our history at O'Reilly.  When we first published about the web in 1992, there were only a few hundred websites. When we launched GNN in 1993, we were the first commercial website.  The web gradually gained momentum, and by 1995, it was in full flower.  But it didn't really hit its investment stride until the late 90s.Ditto the rise of big data, which I first talked about in 2003, and which is everyone's investment thesis today.The Maker movement is on a similar trajectory. We launched Make: Magazine in 2005 and Maker Faire in 2006.  And now, suddenly, everyone is talking sensors, 3D printers, and robotics.We want to hear from companies that have been working unheralded on the next big thing, that will change everything, and where we can see signs that gradual acceptance is going to turn into sudden awareness of just how worldchanging the opportunity is.\ufeff",

He was principal of the Lissivigeen School  starting in 1876, following in the footsteps of his father-in-law, Peter Fleming, who was the first principal of the school, starting in 1861. He was succeeded by my grandfather, James Patrick O'Reilly, who was principal there until 1952. My father, Sean O'Reilly, attended school there, as did his brothers Seumas, Frank, and Ted, and his sister Maureen.  My Aunt Maureen also taught at the school.For more history of the school and my family's role there, see http://lissivigeenschool.com/history.htm.\ufeff",

   "content": "True in Spirit: Why I liked Captain America, But Didn't Like John CarterIn my recent review of John Carter, https://plus.google.com/107033731246200681024/posts/GDSs19osiEC I damned the movie for failing to be true to the book, taking liberties with the story and with the character of John Carter himself. Yet when watching Captain America on the plane the other day, I found myself completely satisfied despite that fact that it too was unfaithful to the original in many ways.I asked myself why, and concluded that the answer is central to understanding O'Reilly's brand marketing, and by extension the authenticity that is at the heart of all great brands.For me as a young reader, the appeal of Captain America (as with Spider Man and other Marvel comics) was the notion that a nerd, a kid who wasn't good at sports and was scorned by popular society, could be transformed into a hero. His smarts, his will, his character were what mattered - all that was required was a chance spark that would transform him into who he really was inside.The movie version of Captain America is completely true to this fantasy. The character of Steve Rogers is so right that I was willing to forgive the many changes to the story (e.g. that Bucky was not his young sidekick but his pre-transformation protector and military buddy), improbabilities such as that the notion of riding a zipline from a mountain down onto the roof of a fast-moving train begs the question of just how they strung that zipline. (I've done it, and it's non-trivial, and gets harder the longer the line.) These are the kinds of errors that I found offensive in John Carter but didn't mind at all in Captain America. I found myself moved by scenes in the movie that demonstrated Steve Rogers' courage, his indomitable will, his loyalty to friends - hell, his nobility. Exactly what Andrew Stanton took away from John Carter!This was equally true in the second installment of Sherlock Holmes, which I likewise saw on a plane last week. It takes even more liberties with Conan Doyle's original stories than John Carter took with Burroughs. Yet once again I consumed it with relish! Why? Because the character of Holmes was so true - his incredible ability to observe tiny details, to think ahead, his remarkable strength (which features in only a few of the stories, but is there nonetheless), his flawed character. And even though the character of Watson was nothing like the Watson of Doyle's stories, I forgave the director, because he made Watson better, not worse than the original. This notion of understanding the essence of what matters about a book, a story, a character, also applies to business. I think about the common thread that runs through all the books we created at O'Reilly - however different they might be. Consider the range of treatment shown by books as diverse as Linux in a Nutshell, Programming Perl, Unix Power Tools, The Perl Cookbook, Head First Java, Mac OS X: The Missing Manual, or Make: Electronics. From the point of view of external details, each of these books was a radical departure from what had gone before, and therefore a potential opportunity to confuse customers and dilute the brand.Yet these books have a common essence: a practical bent, respect for the intelligence of the reader, a clear path to what you need to know, the authentic voice of experience, a willingness to take risks with new tools and new ideas that have been taken up by people on the cutting edge. When they stray from these core features, our books fail.O'Reilly conferences display the same brand essence. In their deepest core, an O'Reilly book and an O'Reilly technical conference have more in common than a technical book from O'Reilly and those from some of our competitors. Like many of our pioneering books, our most successful new conferences were launched because we thought they were needed, not because we necessarily knew how successful they'd be. We weren't chasing dollars; we were trying to help the early adopter communities who are our core customers to change the world.(Of course, it also helped that we created \"brand affordances\" whenever we introduced a new type of book. I remember in the old days hearing that competitors would cheer every time we put out a new book without an animal on the cover. They thought we were throwing away our brand advantage. Little did they know that we were preserving it. Over time, we created a house of powerful brands with a common core but with clearly visible differences and distinct audiences.)This brand essence is also true in our advocacy. We stand up for issues that matter in our industry. We tackle big problems that we don't yet know how to solve, and try to grow markets in ways that benefit others besides ourselves. Hmmm. Maybe that's why I hated John Carter but loved Captain America and Sherlock Holmes . Andrew Stanton's John Carter was a self-absorbed adventurer, a reluctant hero and an anti-romantic, not the noble figure I remembered from my childhood. There's a way in which the O'Reilly brand essence is ultimately a story about the hacker as hero, the kid who is playing with technology because he loves it, but one day falls into a situation where he or she is called on to go forth and change the world. Our editors and conference chairs, our authors and our conference presenters, are drawn from the ranks of our customers, and like all true nerds, we have a secret hunger to be heroes.\ufeff",

The underlying trend as we\u2019ve gone from desktops through laptops and notebooks to tablets is one of having computing available in more places, more of the time. The logical endpoint is computing everywhere, all the time \u2013 that is, wearable computing \u2013 and I have no doubt that 20 years from now that will be standard, probably through glasses or contacts, but for all I know through some kind of more direct neural connection. And I\u2019m pretty confident that platform shift will happen a lot sooner than 20 years \u2013 almost certainly within 10, but quite likely as little as 3-5, because the key areas \u2013 input, processing/power/size, and output \u2013 that need to evolve to enable wearable computing are shaping up nicely, although there\u2019s a lot still to be figured out.Of course, hardware is only as useful as the software running on it, and there\u2019s a vast web of intertwined issues and questions to be resolved about how the combined hardware-software system might work. What does a wearable UI look like, and how does it interact with wearable input? How does the computer know where you are and what you\u2019re looking at? When the human visual system sees two superimposed views, one real and one virtual, what will it accept and what will it reject? To what extent is augmented reality useful \u2013 and if it\u2019s useful, to what extent is it affordably implementable in the near future? What hardware advances are needed to enable the software? \"via +Peter Brantley\ufeff",

Wilson has revolutionized science and inspired the public more often than any other living biologist. Now he is blending his pioneer work on ants with a new perspective on human development to propose a radical reframing of how evolution works.\"First the social insects ruled, from 60 million years ago. Then a species of social mammals took over, from 10 thousand years ago. Both sets of \u201ceusocial\u201d animals mastered the supremely delicate art of encouraging altruism, so that individuals in the groups would act as if they value the goal of the group over their own goals. They would specialize for the group and die for the group. In recent decades the idea of \u201ckin selection\u201d seemed to explain how such an astonishing phenomenon could evolve. Wilson replaces kin selection with \u201cmulti-level selection,\u201d which incorporates both individual selection (long well understood) and group selection (long considered taboo). Every human and every human society has to learn how to manage adroitly the perpetual ambiguity and conflict between individual needs and group needs.\"\ufeff",

That means there\u2019s both the imperative and the market for new, disruptive startups.\"The Code for America Accelerator will \"turbo-charge\" select civic startups by providing them an opportunity to amplify market awareness of their product, to access a wealth of business training and advice, and to be introduced to a broad network of potential investors and civic leaders.\"The 4-month program will focus on early stage startups, providing them the network and training needed to grow their businesses. Every month, the startup teams will be brought together in CfA\u2019s San Francisco offices for intensive week-long curriculum led by industry experts; coupled with networking events with investors. Throughout the remainder of the program, the startups will have access to hands-on mentorship, administrative support, and office space.\"The program will start August 2012; the deadline for applications is June 1, 2012.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "NYT Profile of Robert Caro Gives Insight into How Political Power Really Workshttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/magazine/robert-caros-big-dig.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=allThis New York Times Magazine profile of Robert Caro, author of The Power Broker, the definitive biography of Robert Moses, and The Years of Lyndon Johnson, the even-more definitive multi-volume biography of LBJ, was a delight - a great example of how the curatorial power of a magazine or newspaper can lead you to encounter people and ideas that you might miss if relying only on the more casual, news-driven flow of content from social media.  And if a NYT profile is a more thorough bit of research and writing than a casual blog, how much deeper is the work of the subject of this piece!Caro has been working on his biography of LBJ for over 36 years - a true antithesis to the quick reportage that we take for granted today.  It has grown from a single volume to at least four, and maybe five. He does exhaustive research - seeking out, for example, in researching his biography of Robert Moses, someone who had delivered the newspaper to Moses' parents when he was involved in a scandal, and getting a firsthand account of their reaction!  (His feats of original research are truly astonishing.)But what I found most thought-provoking in the profile was the notion that Caro is less focused on writing biographies of individuals than of  writing \"studies in the working of political power and how it affects both those who have it and those who don't.\"From the article:\"Caro had a further epiphany about power in the early \u201960s. He had moved on to Newsday by then, where he discovered that he had a knack for investigative reporting, and was assigned to look into a plan by Robert Moses to build a bridge from Rye, N.Y., across Long Island Sound to Oyster Bay. \u201cThis was the world\u2019s worst idea,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe piers would have had to be so big that they\u2019d disrupt the tides.\u201d Caro wrote a series exposing the folly of this scheme, and it seemed to have persuaded just about everyone, including the governor, Nelson Rockefeller. But then, he recalled, he got a call from a friend in Albany saying, \u201cBob, I think you need to come up here.\u201d Caro said: \u201cI got there in time for a vote in the Assembly authorizing some preliminary step toward the bridge, and it passed by something like 138-4. That was one of the transformational moments of my life. I got in the car and drove home to Long Island, and I kept thinking to myself: \u2018Everything you\u2019ve been doing is baloney. You\u2019ve been writing under the belief that power in a democracy comes from the ballot box. But here\u2019s a guy who has never been elected to anything, who has enough power to turn the entire state around, and you don\u2019t have the slightest idea how he got it.\u2019 \u201d\"The lesson was repeated in 1965, when Caro had a Nieman fellowship at Harvard and took a class in land use and urban planning. \u201cThey were talking one day about highways and where they got built,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand here were these mathematical formulas about traffic density and population density and so on, and all of a sudden I said to myself: \u2018This is completely wrong. This isn\u2019t why highways get built. Highways get built because Robert Moses wants them built there. If you don\u2019t find out and explain to people where Robert Moses gets his power, then everything else you do is going to be dishonest.\u2019 \u201d\"Caro\u2019s obsession with power explains a great deal about the nature of his work. For one thing, it accounts in large part for the size and scope of all his books, which Caro thinks of not as conventional biographies but as studies in the working of political power and how it affects both those who have it and those who don\u2019t.\"That's a really important insight. Even as we lament its brokenness, we still take for granted that our political system fundamentally works the way that was documented in our eighth-grade civics textbook.  Caro's books apparently study how our system really works.  They just got onto my \"must read\" list.\ufeff",

   "content": "Today is Not Tomorrow: An Analysis of Competitive Dynamics in Ebooks\"Interesting analogies between the collapse of the comic book market and what could happen to books without bookstores http://bit.ly/HPRFVr I'm not sure I buy the analysis of Amazon's weaknesses (though they are food for thought, I believe that Amazon is not dependent on proprietary hardware for their lock-in. Their lock-in comes from the kindle format and the cross-platform availability of the kindle app.  But what I found most interesting was the notion that by wiping out the ecosystem that brings in new readers, Amazon's ebook business could end up in a downward spiral due to the lack of new readers.  I quote:\"The analogy I\u2019ve been using is the comic book\u2019s direct market. This enabled comics publishers to cater to their expert readers, those with an intricate knowledge about past continuity and a burning passion for the medium.But, nobody else went into comic book stores. Kids don\u2019t grow up seeing comics on the newsstands or in bookstores anymore. Comics ceased in the late eighties, early nineties, to have a presence in our public spaces and renewal of the reader-base halted.\"Publishers discovered new ways of squeezing money out of their regulars, but put no thought to where future customers would come from.So, today we have a situation where bestselling comics sell an order of magnitude fewer comics than bestsellers did in the nineties (100 000 copies versus a million versus millions, plural, in the eighties/seventies/sixties)....\"Novels could easily fall into the same trap. Publishers are raising prices to libraries and, in the UK, cutbacks are threatening their very existence. Bookstores are disappearing from malls, retail parks, and the high street. Retailers like WH Smiths focus more on stationary and general goods than they do books, and what few books they have are dominated by celebrity bios and churned non-fiction. Like comics before, novels are slowly disappearing from the public sphere.\"\ufeff",

I agree with Charlie on every point.  He is particularly compelling on the subject of how publishers played right into Amazon's hands by insisting on DRM, and how their only hope is to drop it ASAP.  I've been saying this, to deaf ears in New York, for years.  Publishers need to focus on interoperable ebook standards above all else.  Good for them, good for readers, and good for the industry as a whole.\ufeff",

Under these Newtonian principles, a candidate\u2019s position on an issue tends to stay at rest until an outside force \u2014 the Tea Party, say, or a six-figure credit line at Tiffany \u2014 compels him to alter his stance, at a speed commensurate with the size of the force (usually large) and in inverse proportion to the depth of his beliefs (invariably negligible). This alteration, framed as a positive by the candidate, then provokes an equal but opposite reaction among his rivals.\"But the Romney candidacy represents literally a quantum leap forward. It is governed by rules that are bizarre and appear to go against everyday experience and common sense...\"Nevertheless, close and repeated study of his campaign in real-world situations has yielded a standard model that has proved eerily accurate in predicting Mitt Romney\u2019s behavior in debate after debate, speech after speech...\"Romney's behavior is then explained in terms of various aspects of quantum theory.

   "content": "Should the DOJ Be Watching Amazon Rather Than Apple?The Seattle Times rips into Amazon with this story about their hardball tactics with small publishers, pushing them for more discount.  Money quote:\"When you sell books at a loss, by the millions, to corner the market, you're not interested in competing,\" said novelist Richard Russo, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist. \"You're interested in burying your competitors and then burying the shovel.\"and on the subject of the DOJ suing Apple and five big publishers instead of Amazon, the article echoes my own thoughts (except for the fact that I don't believe the big publishers necessarily conspired around agency pricing - they leapt at the same chance when Apple offered it.):\"The U.S. Justice Department now is considering suing Apple and the five publishers \u2014 Simon & Schuster, Hachette, Penguin, Macmillan and HarperCollins \u2014 on charges they worked together to raise e-book prices.\"That those companies are under investigation for price fixing doesn't diminish claims of an Amazon monopoly, said antitrust expert Michael Carrier, of the Rutgers School of Law in Camden, N.J.\"Carrier believes Amazon is close to gaining monopoly power in the digital-book market. A company generally is determined to have such power when its market share exceeds 70 percent, he said. The question then becomes whether or not it engages in predatory activity.\"If they offer better products and can legitimately sell books better than their competitors, that would not necessarily be a violation of antitrust laws,\" Carrier said.\"If, on the other hand, Amazon is willing to lose profits to set e-book prices below what it's paying publishers, and that doesn't make any sense other than to ensure nobody else can compete, it could be a monopolist.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "The DOJ Gets it Backwards in Ebook Pricing CaseCompelling testimony to DOJ from indie ebook publisher @smashwords in support of agency pricing for ebooks http://bit.ly/H3s7by For those not in publishing, this is a hot controversy, as the DOJ has sued the \"big 6\" publishers for supposedly collude with each other and with Apple to adopt a model in which the publisher sets the price, rather than the retailer. This was done in response to predatory pricing by Amazon, in which they were selling books at lower than cost in order to gain market share and to build the Kindle user base.There was no need for publishers to collude: when Apple asked for this pricing model, it made sense.  But more to the point, as Mark Coker of Smashwords argues, there's plenty of competition when publishers set the price, especially for ebooks, which is an emerging field with thousands of self-publishers competing for attention, while there are only two or three major book retailers left.It's kind of crazy how often regulators are fighting the last war. Can't they see that the concentration of power is now in the hands of retailers, especially Amazon?  Letting publishers set the price is increasing competition, not decreasing it!\ufeff",

   "content": "How Medical Specialists Conspire to Pay Themselves More from MedicareWow. A panel of 29 private doctors decides how the Medicare dollars get allocated to specialties. http://bit.ly/GT4VqN No wonder the system is broken! As seems to be all too usual in things related to our government, it's those who have a financial interest in the system who are skewing it in their favor.  (Note: these are not doctors from the government; they are a panel put together by medical associations.)Paul Levy writes about how it might be different, and if it was, how it would save us money:\"Procedural specialists \u2013 the people who do things to you like surgery, endoscopies, and catheterizations -- have more influence on this panel.  Therefore, the process results in greater values being ascribed to the procedures than to cognitive services \u2013 the doctors who take histories, listen to you, evaluate symptoms, and make recommendation. And greater value translates into higher payment rates for those proceduralists.  Payment levels are skewed away from cognitive specialists, like primary care doctors (PCPs).\"We need to ask the question:  What if the system were changed?  What if primary care doctors were paid more?\"\"It turns out that this would save money for American consumers.\"Read the whole article. And next time you ascribe our health care costs to government inefficiency, consider that they might just be the product of private greed, just like the financial crisis.The problem isn't big government, it's government that doesn't work the way it should: for the people. If it worked for the people, and wasn't captured by predatory private interests, it could be smaller, because it would be more effective. We keep getting into this arms race, where we get more government because it isn't achieving its goals, while the money that could have been used to achieve those goals is siphoned off by bad actors. Of course, that leads to more regulation, more government, because we're not getting where we need to go.There are so many areas that need a reboot. Instead of thinking of government as this big, bad force, think about it as if it were Microsoft Windows, except instead of decades of cruft, it's got centuries, and just needs a massive overhaul.Meanwhile, imagine how well your search engine would work if the ranking algorithms were controlled by content farms and the biggest advertisers, who directed more of the organic search flow to their properties.  That's exactly what we see here.\ufeff",

If this is a sign of things to come, it could mean a lot. It behooves us to pay attention, and to make it a sign of things to come.When popular protest moves advertisers to protest as well, this can be a powerful force for change.\ufeff",

(Her SxSW keynote was even better, but I don't think they made video available. It's also 45 minutes instead of 12, so this is a great place to start.)I love the way that Jen illustrates my notion of \"government as a platform\" in such a simple, down-to-earth way that any non-technical person can understand it. Describing how an open 311 app lets one neighbor help another with a possum problem, rather than calling on expensive city services, she says:\"This is an example of government geting in on the crowdsourcing game,but it\u2019s also an example of government building a platform for people to help themselves and each other. It's citizen to citizen, but government had a critical role \u2013 it connected them. It could have connected them to government services if they\u2019d been needed. But a neighbor helping a neighbor strengthens our communities. Calling government services just costs money.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "The Sad State of the Republican PartyThis January New Yorker piece about the current state of the Republican Party really resonated for me. I used to think of myself as an independent who shared many views with both parties, but the Republican Party has become so extreme that we need a new alternative.  \"In 1959, Vice-President Nixon, speaking to members of California\u2019s Commonwealth Club, was asked if he\u2019d like to see the parties undergo an ideological realignment\u2014the sort that has since taken place\u2014and he replied, \u201cI think it would be a great tragedy . . . if we had our two major political parties divide on what we would call a conservative-liberal line.\u201d He continued, \u201cI think one of the attributes of our political system has been that we have avoided generally violent swings in Administrations from one extreme to the other. And the reason we have avoided that is that in both parties there has been room for a broad spectrum of opinion.\u201d Therefore, \u201cwhen your Administrations come to power, they will represent the whole people rather than just one segment of the people.\u201d Ten months before the general election, the increasingly angry, suspicious, and divided party of Romney, Gingrich, Santorum, and Perry seems ever more immersed in its current orthodoxies. None of the candidates, though, seem the least bit interested in even addressing how they, or their party, might actually govern the \u201cwhole people\u201d of a fractious nation.\"Read more http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2012/01/23/120123taco_talk_frank#ixzz1paCi2szA\ufeff",

   "content": "Help Drive the Data Revolution in Health CareOne of the most important open government initiatives started over the past couple of years is the Health Data Initiative. Unlike many open government data initiatives, which throw open various data sets, and just hope they will become useful, the Department of Health and Human Services has done a great job of reaching out to developers to build great healthcare applications.The idea is to make data from the vaults of HHS (and other sources) available in electronic, machine-readable, downloadable, easily accessible form, and promote its availability to entrepreneurs and innovators (via meetups, challenges, and codeathons) who can turn it into all kinds of applications and services that can help improve health and create jobs at the same time.This is a great example of what I've called \"Government as a platform,\" in which government provides key capabilities that are then expanded upon by the private sector for delivery to the public in a variety of ways.  We're all familiar with this model for weather data. The NOAA launches weather satellites, tracking buoys, and all kinds of other tools for measuring weather, and releases the data to be delivered by commercial companies via television, web applications, and smartphones.  The goal of the Health Data Initiative is to be the NOAA of health data.Machine-readable data resources available from HHS include health care provider quality information, health and human service provider directories, community health performance statistics, the latest and greatest medical knowledge from the National Library of Medicine, Medicare claims data in a variety of forms, and much more.Many companies have built new or upgraded products and services using this data that are already helping millions of Americans.Each year, the initiative hosts a conference (the \"Health Datapalooza\") in June to feature the latest and best open health data applications.  The deadline for applications for this year's event is March 30. There's more information in the blog post below.\ufeff",

The SOPA protests weren't the work of some Silicon Valley lobby; as +Andrew Rasiej said to me recently, they were the work of \"the Internet public.\"(Andrew noted that that lovely term, \"the Internet Public,\" was coined by Dave Parry in his essay \"It\u2019s not the Public Internet, It is the Internet Public.\" http://profoundheterogeneity.com/2011/02/its-not-the-public-internet-it-is-the-internet-public/)\ufeff",

   "content": "This piece from today's NYT, Why I am Leaving Goldman Sachs is another that highlights the corporate corruption that we need to root out if we are going to fix our economy and our society.  I quote from the piece:\"To put the problem in the simplest terms, the interests of the client continue to be sidelined in the way the firm operates and thinks about making money. Goldman Sachs is one of the world\u2019s largest and most important investment banks and it is too integral to global finance to continue to act this way. The firm has veered so far from the place I joined right out of college that I can no longer in good conscience say that I identify with what it stands for....\"It makes me ill how callously people talk about ripping their clients off. Over the last 12 months I have seen five different managing directors refer to their own clients as \u201cmuppets,\u201d sometimes over internal e-mail....\"It astounds me how little senior management gets a basic truth: If clients don\u2019t trust you they will eventually stop doing business with you. It doesn\u2019t matter how smart you are.\"P.S. While I laughed at the sendup of this piece, Why I am Leaving the Empire, by Darth Vader,  (http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5007&amp;Itemid=81 ) I do hope that it doesn't distract from the importance of the piece written by a senior leader at one of our largest and most important financial firms.  We need more corporate leaders to call out their firms and reinstitute a culture of citizenship and social conscience at our corporations.\ufeff",

Great news coverage, but unexpected additions to my mental and cultural life.The article opens with a wonderful narrative, framing a heart-stopping poem from a poet I've never heard of, but whose book I am now rushing to buy.  Here's the opening of the article, and that first poem:\"Several people in my life revere Jack Gilbert. They push photocopies of his poems solemnly across tables at me, as if they were salary offers or handguns or unusual drugs. Here, they say. Read this.\"Among the poems by Mr. Gilbert that are passed around like samizdat is a bonsai-size heartbreaker titled \u201cGames,\u201d from his 1982 collection, \u201cMonolithos.\u201d Here is that poem in its entirety:    Imagine if suffering were real.    Imagine if those old people were afraid of death.    What if the midget or the girl with one arm    really felt pain? Imagine how impossible it would be    to live if some people were    alone and afraid all their lives.\"This is a poem that, watching cable news, you long to staple to certain pundits\u2019 foreheads.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "The Culture of Corporate CorruptionIn my talk at  #sxsw  yesterday, I talked about a culture of corporate corruption that has been an enabler for the breakdown of our economy. (Specifically, I talked about my experience at the Stanford Directors College some years ago, in which I expected to learn about how to be a good director of a public company, guidance on how best to look out for the interests of the shareholders, and instead was treated to session after session about director liability and how to cover my ass.)There were a couple of great illustrations of this breakdown of business morality in today's New York Times. The first, and most striking, was Andrew Ross Sorkin's piece about bankers not disclosing conflicts of interest in M&amp;A deals (one example was of a Goldman Sachs banker who owned a significant shareholding in a company being acquired by the company whose interests he was supposedly representing), and the complicity of law firms in whitewashing these conflicts.The other was about the potential failure of prosecutors to be able to hold MF Global for raiding customer funds in a last-minute attempt to prop up their firm. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/13/opinion/nocera-is-mf-global-getting-a-free-pass.html?_r=1These are two of many examples of the pervasive corruption of values that came to a head in the financial crisis of 2008, but has still not resulted in the kind of reforms that we need.We need a shareholder revolt with a focus on good corporate governance. Thomas Jefferson once said that for liberty to flourish, government should fear the people. There is a parallel notion corporations should fear their shareholders. Right now, corporate leaders continue to act like aristocrats before the French Revolution.\ufeff",

Nick was the one who called bullshit on the notion of trickle-down economics with the statement \"Investors don't create jobs. Customers create jobs.\" Nick's TEDU talk isn't yet online (I hope it goes up soon), but you can find more of his ideas at http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Gardens_of_DemocracyThe others were appropriately credited but I thought I'd make it easier for you to find them.Andy McAfee and +Erik Brynjolfsson's book Race Against the Machine is an analysis of the future of work in the face of competition with robots and AIs, and one of the sparks for my notion that we are going to have to find new and creative ways to put labor back into the economy. You can learn more about it here: http://raceagainstthemachine.com/The 1975 article I referred to, \"The Clothesline Paradox\", by Steve Baer, can be found here: http://www.wholeearth.com/issue/2008/article/358/the.clothesline.paradoxThe Rilke poem I cited (in my own idiosyncratic retelling rather than translation) is called \"The Man Watching.\" You can read it here, in Robert Bly's translation: http://www.poetry-chaikhana.com/R/RilkeRainerM/ManWatching.htmThe line about what you're doing now being what you'd be willing to die for, since you could die at any moment is from +Daniel Keys Moran's wonderful science-fiction novel The Last Dancer. http://www.amazon.com/Last-Dancer-Bantam-spectra-book/dp/0553562495The NZ farmer-maker I referred to is +John Hart,@farmgeek on twitter.The notion that government policy should protect the future from the past is one that I first heard from +Larry Lessig.If there are any references that I missed, remind me in the comments.\ufeff",

   "content": "I saw John Carter so you don't have toAs a kid, I was a huge fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs. I read everything he wrote, and the covers of the Grosset and Dunlap editions of Tarzan with the fabulous dust jackets still have a Proustian \"madeleine in tea\" power to evoke the memory of the high shelf in the stacks of the Parkside Library in San Francisco where the books were kept. To be honest, the Mars series were my least favorite Burroughs, but still, how could I not see a movie that would feature \"the hurtling moons of mars\"?And after seeing +Andrew Stanton's TED talk about film storytelling, I was really hopeful.  http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_stanton_the_clues_to_a_great_story.htmlWell, I was disappointed.  Here are a few reasons:1. The character of John Carter was all wrong - brutish and stupid, far from the chivalrous Virginia gentleman of the books. They abandoned the unabashed romanticism of Burroughs in favor of a modern anti-hero whose tortured path to falling in love with Dejah Thoris, a Princess of Mars, was completely unconvincing. I wonder at this failure to grasp the simplicity of emotion that suffused the golden age of science-fiction. George Lucas nailed it perfectly in the first Star Wars trilogy. Nobility of purpose, idealism, the pure romance of a boy (or girl) who hasn't yet experienced the complications of the real thing, adventure and the chance to make a big difference against impossible odds:  these are the motivations of the genre.2. Too much spectacle, not enough attention to character and story.  And what spectacle there was was undistinguished. There was a certain steampunk grandiosity to the way they did the flying ships of Barsoom that I liked, and there were some stretches of Lake Powell as the River Iss that I found visually compelling.3. A faux subplot involving manipulation by \"the Gods of Mars\" that was absent from the original, and unnecessary. I hate it when filmmakers adapting books that have been loved by millions don't trust their material and decide to \"improve on it.\"4. The depiction of John Carter's strength and leaping ability in low Martian gravity defied all laws of physics, and was depressingly inconsistent with gravity 1/3 that of earth. At times he looked more like superman. We know this is a fantasy, but consistency is what makes that plausible.  The scene in which he first came to grips with his new abilities was like an amateurish rip-off of the awakening to power scene in the first SpiderMan movie (which was absolutely brilliant - the scene by which other superhero movies should be measured.) Oh yeah, and \"the hurtling moons of Mars\" pretty much stood still. (Of course, Burroughs was wrong in his depiction. Per Wikipedia \"Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just eleven hours, while Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit, rises as expected in the east but very slowly. Despite its 30 hour orbit, it takes 2.7 days to set in the west as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars, and has long again to rise.\"  But in the imagined world of John Carter, images like this matter.)5. The Tharks looked and acted like four-armed versions of Jar-Jar Binks. In short, this movie is in the science-fiction tradition of late George Lucas, when it should have emulated his early brilliance.I rest my case.That being said, per Rotten Tomatoes, audiences liked it better than critics, and there were people in my theater in NYC who clapped at the end, and several bursts of audience-wide laughter or amazement. So if you're not a purist, YMMV.\ufeff",

   "content": "An unusual, wonderful, even visionary account of the early years of computers - a source of koans for codersI haven't yet read +George Dyson's book Turing's Cathedral but I've watched its development, and heard George talk about it many times. (His keynote at OSCON a half-dozen years ago got a standing ovation.)  George is a wonderful historian and a keen thinker.This Guardian review is mixed but overwhelmingly positive, and suggests that that book is one of those rare books that matter. After criticizing the book for its sprawling difficulty, the review outlines three reasons why it is a \"must-read\":\"One: no other book about the beginnings of the digital age brings to life anything like so vividly or appreciatively the immense engineering difficulty of creating electronic logic for the first time; of creating originally, and without a template, the pattern of organisation which has since become absolutely routine, and been etched on silicon at ever smaller micron-distances in chip foundries. ...\"Two: no other book has engaged so intelligently and disconcertingly with the digital age's relationship to nuclear weapons research, not just as a moral quandary to do with funding, but as an indispensable developmental influence ....\"Three: no other book \u2013 this is where we get visionary \u2013 makes the connections this one does between the lessons of the computer's origin and the possible paths of its future.\"+John Brockman titled his email to the Edge.org mailing list \"An unusual, wonderful, even visionary account of the early years of computers - a source of koans for coders.\" That seems a nice summary of George's book.\ufeff",

   "content": "Measuring the Economic Impact of the Sharing EconomyWhile at our Strata Conference, I stopped by +John Furrier's Cube for an interview. We talked about a lot of things, but this is probably the first public airing of some ideas I've been thinking a lot about lately, namely how we can best measure the economic impact of what Lisa Gansky calls the sharing economy.I start with a paper I read in the 70s, Steve Baer's \"Clothesline Paradox,\" which pointed out that when people hang their clothes on the line rather than putting them in the dryer, that reduction in demand doesn't go on our energy books as a credit to the renewables column, it just disappears from our accounting.The same is true of open source software, or, for that matter, of most of the products of what +Clay Shirky calls \"cognitive surplus.\" This discussion is important in many contexts. For example, when talking about SOPA/PIPA, the movie industry talked about economic impact while the internet industry talked about freedom. Yet it's quite clear to me that there is a new economy of content that is quite possibly larger than the old one, but just not as well measured, because we measure value captured, not value created for users.In other fields, we celebrate lower prices for consumers and expansion of demand, but here, paradoxically, we are ignoring it, as well as ignoring the many real economic transactions that do occur. I intend to pull together some people to change that.\ufeff",

It was to uncover and to reveal\u2014rather like scientists; for design is just a tangible, natural, and objective byproduct of history. As Michl put it, \u201cFunctional forms do not simply appeal to taste, because they are a matter of truth\u2014and truth does not pander to taste.\u201d It is no wonder that the functionalists loved to tout the supposed timelessness of their forms: truth, after all, has only one timeless form, or so many members of the Bauhaus believed. (That the modern epoch may eventually come to an end and be followed by an epoch with a different set of values and needs did not occur to them.) It\u2019s no wonder that the highest compliment that Jony Ive could bestow on Dieter Rams was to call the design of his products 'inevitable.'\"The piece starts with a riff on the shallowness of Isaacson's biography, but soon goes into an amazing romp through design antecedents for Jobs' philosophy of design. A must-read for Apple enthusiasts.\ufeff",

In the privacy realm, companies like Google and Facebook are being held to a far higher standard than brick and mortar companies that have been collecting information like this for years. As Lauren puts it:\"In the brick and mortar world, personally identifiable information like credit card purchases, banking activities and even voting records have long been mashed into a commodity that is sliced, diced and sold. It is literally worth more than the sum of its parts to giant credit reporting firms who control the destiny of anyone who wants to rent an apartment, lease a car or engage in many other kinds of transactions.\"The irony is that the impacts of this bread crumb trail are blithely ignored by most of us since they\u2019re generally not obvious, not \u201cin our faces\u201d so to speak \u2014 until you are denied credit or perhaps even a job, that is.\"So is the situation better or worse for us in the digital realm? From the hue and cry over \u201cDo Not Track,\u201d you might think the latter. You would be wrong.\"Read Lauren's entire op-ed, and then discuss here.\ufeff",

It was when my daughter was about ten, and we had a sleepover at the museum. For a demo, they asked for a parent to volunteer to count to ten for the kids.  I couldn't do it.  I found my tongue literally twisting in my mouth as I tried to count.  (They also had a version of this demo on the museum floor, but that one was less loud, and you could see how you could train yourself to overcome it.)And at the first Foo Camp, Bernie Krause brought a \"sound cannon\" - a directed sound projector.  Also an amazing tool - you could hear loud sound in the portion of the room it was pointed at, and not anywhere else.This project apparently puts those two ideas together. A little scary to think of this as a police tool at protest rallies...http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/242444.php\ufeff",

   "content": "+Jennifer Pahlka of Code for America gave an inspiring TED talk this afternoon about how technology can help change government . +Abhi Nemani collected some of the twitter stream as a Storify.http://storify.com/abhinemani/jennifer-pahlka-at-tedYou can get more (there were some great one-liners, many of them tweeted) via https://twitter.com/#!/search/pahlka  (But don't confuse her TEDxSF video, which some people have tweeted, with her actual TED talk today, which isn't up online yet. The TEDx talk was good too, but this one knocked it out of the park.)Here are a few of my own favorite lines (may not be exact quotes):\"Government is like a vast ocean. Politics is the six-inch layer on top.\"\"We think politics is sexy. But if we're going to fix government, we have to make bureaucracy sexy.\"On OccupyTheSEC's 325 page response to the SEC's request for comment on financial reform regulations:\"That's not being politically active. That's being bureaucratically active.\"On the need to do something, not just complain:\"If we're going to fix government, we're going to have to fix citizenship.\"\"When it comes to dealing with the big problems we face, are we just going to be a crowd of voices, or are we going to be a crowd of hands?\"\ufeff",

Yet you insure against that car accident, but we as a civilization haven't done the same for the possiblility of a far-more serious \"cosmic car accident.\"That insurance ought to take the form of a space mission to survey all earth-crossing asteroids. Armed with that information, we could map out if and when any asteroids might hit the earth in time to deflect them. The science is known; the political will is lacking.When NASA gave up on the survey mission, astronauts Rusty Schweikert and Ed Lu decided to do something about it.  They formed the B612 Foundation http://b612foundation.org.  As Ed says, this has at least the potential of being the single most important project in human history. If we find nothing, we can breathe a big sigh of relief.  If we do nothing, we might wake up one day to a very unpleasant surprise.Follow @astroEdLu for more.\ufeff",

The Mini-Maker Faire movement is really gaining steam, and will have a huge impact. via +Sabrina Merlo http://grathio.com/2012/02/mini-maker-faires-are-just-as-great-as-full-maker-faires\"Talking with an attendee who had been at the very first Bay Area Maker Faire in 2006 I realized that the \u201cmini\u201d gatherings have all the important elements of the big ones.  Yes, there are fewer people spraying the audience with Mentos and Coke, no one was playing music with giant tesla coils, and no one from Mythbusters showed up. But I didn\u2019t miss them because the fun part, interacting with makers, was in full force. There was a lot of seeing the awesome, weird, unusual, scary, whimsical stiff that people have but together and getting to talk to them, hear their story, see what they did, hear what they did wrong, what they discovered. It\u2019s the chance to spend the day interacting with really interesting people.  Just like the full-sized faires.\"\ufeff",

So long as you buy it as soon as it\u2019s possible to do so, I can confidently reach for my \u201cNo Harm Done\u201d rubber stamp. Some content is commercially unavailable because the publisher or distributor has no desire to ever release it. I\u2019ll even go so far as to say that downloading it illegally is a positive thing; you\u2019re helping to keep this creative work alive.\"If you avoid purchasing the media in some form, however\u2026you\u2019re just one of those people who prefer to steal things if they think they can get away with it. Simple as that. Get off your high horse.\" This is an important point. If you want to have moral grounds for illegal downloading, you should a) have already paid for the content at least once (e.g. if you are an HBO subscriber, and could have time-shifted the content, but found downloading easier) or b) pay for it when it does become available.Discuss.\ufeff",

Since they no longer own the copies, they have tried extending the reach of their exclusive right to \u201cdistribute\u201d copies to encompass copies they no longer own. For just as long, the courts and Congress have rebuffed those efforts. Today, however, the United States Trade Representative is negotiating with foreign countries to obligate Congress and the courts to give them that power, even as their latest in a series of efforts to extend the existing distribution right is pending before the Supreme Court.\"There's lots more, all illustrating a point that +Jennifer Pahlka of Code for America has made often, that we need to become \"bureaucratically active,\" not just \"politically active.\" Lobbyists are engaging way down in the ocean of government, not just in the shallow political layer at the top, and the public learns of it far too late.\ufeff",

   "content": "Librarians as Social WorkersThis is a must-read post on metafilter from a librarian, which makes the \"Digital Divide\" viscerally clear, and explains the role of libraries in bridging that divide. I won't try to do it justice. Just read it.Alas, as budget cuts push libraries to the brink, this librarian (a library science student) wonders if libraries will survive, and if they don't, who or what will fill their role:\"We need to do something which I'll admit is ill defined and perhaps impossible: we need to become the center of civic engagement in our communities. We're one of the few places left in our society where a great cross-section of people regularly interact, and also one of the few places that is free and non-commercial. Even museums, to bow and scrape to the master of Austerity, have begun to put branding on their exhibits, as if they were a sort of cultural NASCAR. We have amazing potential power, but without concerted effort I'm afraid it will be wasted. It will look better to save 10 dollars a year per person in taxes instead of funding community computer workshops, and childhood literacy programs, and community gardens. All the while we play desperate catch-up, trying to get a hold on ebooks, and licensing out endless sub-quality software for meeting room reservations and computer sign-ups and all this other rentier software capitalism instead of developing free and open source solutions and providing small systems with the expertise to use them. Our amazing power is squandered as we cut our staff, fail to attract skilled and diverse talent, and act as a band aid to the mounting social ills caused by slash and burn governance in the name of low taxes and some nebulous idea of freedom that seems to equate with living in a good society but not paying your share for it.\"The irony is that I had just tweeted a link to another wonderful post by a librarian, which argued against all the angst, and just urged librarians to \"Play the long game, go out there and do something awesome.\" It's also worth reading: http://bit.ly/AitSX3 And yes, there are amazing projects to turn libraries into makerspaces and other kinds of community resource, but let's not forget the trailing edge, made so vivid here, in our rush to the leading edge.via +Max Ogden\ufeff",

Modern elections just don't add up, the author, David Mayhew, concludes.But I think that the author's historical hindsight should be turned forward. It seems to me that the election of 2000 might well be up there. Without the election of George W. Bush, I don't think we would have danced quite so hard to Bin Laden's tune, leading the country into two wars (one of which was entirely gratuitous). Nor would we have had the runaway deficit spending (including the cost of those two wars) that bankrupted our economy.Even more importantly, we had no action on climate change, and an administration that pretended that what might be the greatest challenge to modern civilization was nothing to worry about. I suspect our descendants, if they care about these things, will indeed regard the election of 2000 as a decisive point in the history not just of our country, but of the world.\ufeff",

   "content": "Proud to have published technical books that still deliver value after 20+ yearsIt's amazing to me how books I first published more than 20 years ago are still creating value for readers. +O'Reilly Media is running an ebook sale for some of our \"classics\": http://oreil.ly/wirQFO (Update: the correct account for O'Reilly Media is +O'Reilly: https://plus.google.com/u/0/108442503368488643007/posts For some reason, it won't expand into a +name when I try to edit the post, so I'm including a link instead.)Vi and Vim is an updated edition of a book we first published in 1986! Linda Lamb was the original author; I was the editor, and added quite a bit of material of my own. (In those days, being the \"editor\" for us really meant being ghostwriter and closet co-author.) I still use and love vi/vim.DNS and Bind has an interesting back story too. In the late 80s or early 90s, I was looking for an author for a book on smail, a new competitor to sendmail that seemed to me to have some promise. I found Cricket Liu, and he said, \"what I really want to write a book about is Bind and the Domain Name System. Trust me, it's more important than smail.\" The internet was just exploding beyond its academic roots (we were still using UUCP!), but I did trust him. We published the first edition in 1992, and it's been a bestseller ever since.Unix in a Nutshell was arguably our very first book. I created the first edition in 1984 for a long-defunct workstation company called Masscomp; we then licensed it to other companies, adapting it for their variants of Unix. In 1986, we published a public edition in two versions: System V and BSD. The original editions were inspired by the huge man page documentation sets that vendors were shipping at the time: I wanted to have something handy to look up command-line options, shell syntax, regular expression syntax, sed and awk command syntax, and even things like the ascii character set. The books were moderately successful until I tried a price drop from the original $19.50 to $9.95 as an experiment, with the marketing headline \"Man bites dog.\" I told people we'd try the new price for six months, and if it doubled sales, we'd keep it. Instead, the enormous value proposition increased sales literally by an order of magnitude. At the book's peak, we were selling tens of thousands of copies a month.Every other \"in a nutshell\" book we published derived from this one, a product line that collectively sold millions of copies, and helped put O'Reilly on the map.Essential System Administration is another book that dates back to our early days as a documentation consulting company. I wrote the first edition of this book for Masscomp in 1984; it might well be the first Unix system administration book ever written. I had just written a graphics programming manual for Masscomp, and was looking for another project. I said, \"When any of us have any problems with our machines, we go to Tom Texeira. Where are our customers going to go?\" So I interviewed Tom, and wrote down what he knew. (That was the origin of so many of our early books - and the origin of the notion of \"capturing the knowledge of innovators.\")I acquired the rights back from Masscomp, and licensed the book to a company called Multiflow, where +Mike Loukides ran the documentation department. Mike updated the book. +Aeleen Frisch, who was working for Mike, did yet another edition for Multiflow, and when the company went belly up, I acquired back the improved version (and hired Mike as our first editor besides me and Dale). He signed Aeleen to develop it as a much more comprehensive book, which has been in print ever since.Sed and Awk has a funny backstory too. It was one of the titles that inspired the original animal designs. +edie freedman thought Unix program names sounded like weird animals, and this was one of the titles she chose to make a cover for, even though the book didn't exist yet. We'd hear for years that people knew it existed - they'd seen it. +Dale Dougherty eventually sat down and wrote it, mostly because he loved awk but also just to satisfy those customers who just knew it existed. (For a brief history of how Edie came up with the idea for the animal book covers, see http://oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/news/ediemals_0400.html )And then there's Unix Power Tools. In the late 80s, Dale had discovered hypertext via Hypercard, and when he discovered Viola and the World Wide Web, that became his focus. We had written a book called Unix Text Processing together, and I was hoping to lure him back to writing another book that exercised the hypertext style of the web, but in print. Dale was working on GNN by that time (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Network_Navigator ) and couldn't be lured onto the project, but I was having so much fun that I kept going. I recruited Jerry Peek and +Mike Loukides to the project. It was a remarkable book both in being crowdsourced - we collected material from existing O'Reilly books, from saved Usenet posts, and from tips submitted by customers - and in being cross-linked like the web. Jerry built some great tools that allowed us to assign each article a unique ID, which we could cross-reference by ID in the text. As I rearranged the outline, the cross-references would automatically be updated. (It was all done with shell scripts, sed, and awk.)Lots more in this trip down memory lane. But the fact is we've kept the books alive, kept updating them, and they are still selling, and still helping people do their jobs, decades later. It's something that makes me proud.\ufeff",

I was trying to frame lessons from technology, including the notions of collective intelligence, man-machine symbiosis, real time feedback loops from sensors, to provide a context for understanding the role of tools like FrontlineSMS, Ushahidi, Crowdflower, Samasource and the like in their work. (I also give a shout out to Dave Warner's Beer for Data program in Afghanistan, and Claire Lockhart's Fixing Failed States.)As I've been doing a lot lately, I took off from Google's autonomous vehicle, because it brings together so many key themes in the technologies that are shaping the future, and by unpacking the technology behind this vehicle, you get deeper insight into where technology is taking us, and the fusion of machine learning and collective intelligence that is powering that future.\ufeff",

   "content": "Fascinating argument by G.K. Chesterton, from his 1908 essay Why I am not a socialist, for why a system of mandated sharing lacks the magic of voluntary giving. While it's clear that this argument could be used to justify a system of selfishness, that is clearly not its intent. Instead, it's a call for generosity as a \"mystical and godlike act.\"http://dl.lib.brown.edu/pdfs/1140813731375533.pdf page 189 (seven pages into the facsimile)\"Giving a thing to another man is as much based on personal property as keeping it to yourself....\u201cIf I were a poet writing an Utopia, if I were a magician waving a wand, if I were a God making a planet, I would deliberately make it a world of give and take, rather than a world of sharing. I do not wish Jones and Brown to share the same cigar box; I do not want it as an ideal; I do not want it as a very remote ideal. I do not want it at all. I want Jones by one mystical and godlike act to give a cigar to Brown and Brown, by another mystical and godlike act, to give a cigar to Jones. Thus it seems to me instead of one act of fellowship (of which memory would slowly fade), we should have a continual play and energy of new acts of fellowship keeping up the circulation of society.\u201d I should add that this entire facsimile edition of an issue of 1908 newsletter called The New Age reminds us that the spirit of blogging was alive and well in the days of print. Some amazing authors from the past here, discussing the urgent topics of the day, showing their biases and time-boundedness, just as we are showing ours to our descendants as we write today.(Found after a bit of Googling to find the source of a quote sent to me in email by my brother Sean.)\ufeff",

For example, the post notes that since Jobs never sold his stock, simply borrowing against it, his widow now has to pay no tax at all, even if she sells the stock, since she inherits it at its current value free and clear of tax.  (I'm not a tax lawyer, and can't attest that every detail here is correct, but I have heard this same story from tax accountants as well as from very rich friends.)It would be really good to have a simple tax system with lower rates and fewer dodges, IMO.  Of course, that's not possible with human nature, since whatever simplification occurs will soon be gamed, which is why we need a complete overhaul of the tax system every once in a while....Nice to see that Zuck at least appears to be planning to pay some tax (but the story might have that wrong too.  Unless he's doing this with the intention to pay tax, I can't imagine why he'd sell the shares he exercised (which would be subject to ordinary income unless they were held long enough to get capital gains) rather than simply selling some of his founders shares, which he's held since the beginning, and replace them with newly exercised shares, to get the clock ticking for capital gains rate on those shares too.I guess what I'm saying is that from a tax accountant's point of view, this story probably is as full of holes as swiss cheese, but the notion that the rich do have some very easy ways to avoid paying any tax at all is quite sound, and the technique fairly common among those with large company shareholdings.\ufeff",

(As I share photos from my NZ trip, I'm amazed at just how difficult it is to add photos to an album, to arrange them, etc. It's easier if you go over to Picasa, which automagically gives access to the same albums.  But there's some really crazy stuff if you try to do it directly in G+, like not filtering out duplicate uploads, no tools for arranging the photos in albums - they appear in the album in selection order, not time order, etc.)I'm actually going to download the ebook and see whether it helps. But the one issue of course is that G+ is evolving quickly to address some of the worst issues.Let me know what you think of the book.\ufeff",

(Unfortunately, no public sharing of photographs allowed.)  Also we got to see the setup where they are doing amazing montage photographs of their type specimens of insect species.  They basically take several hundred images with slightly different focus, and then stitch them together into what appears to be almost a 3D image, in which every level of depth is in identical clear focus. They are truly stunning, and this is difficult, exacting work.  When they are ready, these images will be made available online. Again, no photos allowed - except this one that I was able to take of one of the images that was out in the public area of the museum.We also got to see a book containing bark fabric samples collected by Captain Cook, which were published in a series of limited edition books, one of which is held in the research collection at the museum.  The fabric samples are stunning.  I hope they eventually digitize these properly.\ufeff",

It's going to be very different from what it was.  We're going to have to find new ways to put labor back into the economy.  I've been working on some longer thoughts about that, but thought I'd share this link to get the conversation started:http://www.weforum.org/content/great-transformation-shaping-new-models\"We need a fourth new model for job creation. The global economy is growing more slowly, productivity is still making substantial progress and unemployment is skyrocketing. We also know that hundreds of millions of people will enter the job market in the next decade. In addition to the productivity increases driven by greater resource efficiency, the industry model is changing and moving upscale, where fewer people can produce much more value.\"The key to mitigating a catastrophic situation is to provide young people with the capability to create their own jobs: to move from the pure concept of unemployment to the concept of micro-entrepreneurship. This will require fundamental changes in educational systems, nurturing a societal spirit of entrepreneurial risk-taking, allowing true gender equality \u2013 to integrate the other half of hidden talents \u2013 and making innovation and the support of innovation a key imperative in public and private life. The success of any national and business model for competitiveness in the future will be less based on capital and much more based on talent. I define this transition as moving from capitalism to \u201ctalentism\u201d.\ufeff",

   "content": "Tony Hsieh thinks big when it comes to the city where he lives and works. He is spending $350 million to rebuild downtown Las Vegas.Tony showed me some of what he was doing when I was in Vegas this summer. His dreams are impressive and exciting. I love how he's investing in the place where he lives.  We should all endeavor to do this.From the article:\"Indeed, the motivation for Hsieh's big bet comes from his long-held philosophy that serendipitous interactions, or what he likes to call spontaneous \"collisions\" between people, are what spark ideas and what facilitate relationships that lead to stronger ties -- and stronger ties lead to more ideas. It's why he's poured such effort into building Zappos' into a place where \"culture magicians\" work their magic and where streamers, balloons and toy figurines seem to spill out of every cubicle.But for all its zaniness, Zappos is still located in a sprawling suburban office park; the nearest bar where employees can collide after work is almost a half-mile away, next to a big highway. When it came time to think about a new home for the company, Hsieh decided the best way to create those interactions is to drop his employees in the middle of a vibrant downtown and let the surroundings facilitate the interaction. \"When you're in a city, the bar or the restaurant becomes an extended conference room,\" he says. Since downtown Vegas didn't really have that yet, Hsieh says, \"The idea went from 'let's build a campus' to 'let's build a city.'\"It's a stark rejection of the prevailing Silicon Valley approach: build a massive, all-encompassing office campus and fill it with perks so your employees won't leave. But Hsieh has never aligned himself much with the prevailing wisdom, and doesn't see himself as a tech CEO (\"we don't see ourselves as a tech company; we're a customer service company,\" he is known to clarify).\ufeff",

   "content": "What Libraries Teach Us About the Role of Free Copies in the Discovery and Sale of ContentI've long argued that publishing is an ecosystem whose robustness depends on lots and lots of different ways to discover content, and it's great to see more people picking up the theme. I really enjoyed this Library Journal piece by +Heather McCormack, which highlights the role that libraries and independent bookstores play in the overall success of publishing.http://reviews.libraryjournal.com/2012/01/in-the-bookroom/publishing/a-most-optimistic-unconference-publishers-libraries-and-independent-bookstores-at-digital-book-world-2012/Here are a few tidbits from the piece:\"Library Journal\u2019s Patron Profiles research series (http://www.thedigitalshift.com/research/patron-profiles/) started in October 2011 with the publication of Volume 1: Understanding the Behavior and Preferences of U.S. Public Library Users. While it\u2019s wrongheaded to argue that library purchases are \u201clost sales\u201d or that library patronage will make a publisher millions overnight, Patron Profiles demonstrates a clear link between borrowing books and purchasing them, not to mention a discovery opportunity for publishers.\"The study identified a group called the \u201cPower Patrons\u201d\u2014those who visit the physical library at least once a week. On average, they borrow 42 books a year and buy ten. Forty percent of them reported purchasing a title they had previously borrowed, and two-thirds said they bought a book written by an author they discovered in the library. I have no evidence to suggest that exposing this group to more books would mean more sales, but as was pointed out by the Verso study, word of mouth is essential to marketing, and Power Patrons are also active users of social media.\"This library data also has great relevance to the SOPA/PIPA debate, and the notion of losses from piracy. I repeat: \"On average, they borrow 42 books a year and buy ten. Forty percent of them reported purchasing a title they had previously borrowed, and two-thirds said they bought a book written by an author they discovered in the library.\" I'll venture that the same is true of file-sharing users. In fact, that's exactly what Brian O'Leary found in the study he did with O'Reilly a few years back: http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/01/book-piracy-drm-data.htmlP.S. Here's one of the first pieces I wrote on the subject of the publishing ecosystem, back in 1995, Publishing Models for Internet Commerce. http://tim.oreilly.com/articles/pubmod.htmlAnd here's one from 2000: The Ecology of eBook Publishing http://tim.oreilly.com/articles/drmtalk.html\ufeff",

I hope Congress pays attention. From the report:\"The report notes box office revenues grew 25 percent from 2006 to 2010, increasing from $25.5 billion to $31.8 billion. Meanwhile, spending on entertainment as a percentage of household income rose 15 percent from 2000 to 2008, and entertainment-sector employment grew 20 percent during that same decade.\"The report says growth in employment for independent artists was especially strong during the last decade, at 43 percent, suggesting the Internet has actually made it easier for content creators to support themselves.\"This may be a strong hint as to why you hear reports of industry 'demise' from certain legacy players: because new technologies and services have made it much easier for content creators to find success without going through the traditional gatekeepers,\" the report states. \"It also raises questions for those who claim that the changing marketplace has been most difficult for independent artists. The data simply does not back that up.\"For what its worth, this data is quite consistent with what we've seen at O'Reilly, as I've documented in a number of recent G+ posts.Here's a link to the actual report:http://www.ccianet.org/CCIA/files/ccLibraryFiles/Filename/000000000586/TheSkyIsRising7-130.pdfHollywood may claim that the report is biased because it's from a computer industry association. Yet the numbers seem far more credible (and easily verifiable) than any put forward by the MPAA.\ufeff",

At the time, most forms of reliable economic knowledge were organized within feudal, patrimonial, and tribal relationships. If you wanted to know who owned land or owed a debt, it was a fact recorded locally\u2014and most likely shielded from outsiders. At the same time, the world was expanding. Travel between cities and countries became more common and global trade increased. The result was a huge rift between the old, fragmented social order and the needs of a rising, globalizing market economy.\"To prevent the breakdown of industrial and commercial progress, hundreds of creative reformers concluded that the world needed a shared set of facts. Knowledge had to be gathered, organized, standardized, recorded, continually updated, and easily accessible\u2014so that all players in the world's widening markets could, in the words of France's free-banking champion Charles Coquelin, \"pick up the thousands of filaments that businesses are creating between themselves.\"\"The result was the invention of the first massive \"public memory systems\" to record and classify\u2014in rule-bound, certified, and publicly accessible registries, titles, balance sheets, and statements of account\u2014all the relevant knowledge available, whether intangible (stocks, commercial paper, deeds, ledgers, contracts, patents, companies, and promissory notes), or tangible (land, buildings, boats, machines, etc.). Knowing who owned and owed, and fixing that information in public records, made it possible for investors to infer value, take risks, and track results. The final product was a revolutionary form of knowledge: \"economic facts.\"\"Over the past 20 years, Americans and Europeans have quietly gone about destroying these facts. The very systems that could have provided markets and governments with the means to understand the global financial crisis\u2014and to prevent another one\u2014are being eroded. Governments have allowed shadow markets to develop and reach a size beyond comprehension. Mortgages have been granted and recorded with such inattention that homeowners and banks often don't know and can't prove who owns their homes. In a few short decades the West undercut 150 years of legal reforms that made the global economy possible.\"The results are hardly surprising. In the U.S., trust has broken down between banks and subprime mortgage holders; between foreclosing agents and courts; between banks and their investors\u2014even between banks and other banks. ...\"We are now staring at a legal and political challenge. A legal challenge because American and European governments allowed economic activity to cross the line from the rule-bound system of property rights, where facts can be established, into an anarchic legal space, where arbitrary interests can trump facts and paper swirls out of control. The rule of law is much more than a dull body of norms: It is a huge, thriving information and management system that filters and processes local data until it is transformed into facts organized in a way that allows us to infer if they hang together and make sense.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "Data for the Public GoodIn the first of the public lectures at Code for America sponsored by EMC/Greenplum, +Michal Migurski talks about Stamen Design's work in visualization. Some key points:- Data Drives Demand. When Stamen launched crimespotting.org, it made people aware that the data existed.  It was there, but until they put visualization front and center, it might as well not have been.- Public Demand drives better data. Crimespotting led Oakland to improve their data publishing practices. The stability of the data and publishing on the web made it possible to have this data addressable with public links. There's an \"official version\", and that version is public, rather than hidden.- Facts = Public Memory. Michal makes the point that the financial crisis was partly a crisis of public knowledge. He points to an article by Hernando de Soto, The Destruction of Economic Facts: http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_19/b4227060634112.htm- Version Control Adds Dimension to Data. Part of what matters so much when open source, the web, and open data meet government is that practices that developers take for granted become part of the way the public gets access to data. Rather than static snapshots, there's a sense that you can expect to move through time with the data.Moving on, +Eric Rodenbeck shows some fabulous visualizations of housing data. It's amazing to watch the organic growth of San Francisco (based on Trulia data) from the 1850s through the present, versus the almost stamped out growth of subdivisions in a Texas town (don't remember which one.) Also a great visualization of rent vs buy - NYC is so overwhelmingly better to rent, just about the only city in the US where that's so.He also gives us a lovely tour of a watercolor-style map visualization that Stamen is working on.  (This is +Aaron Straup Cope's work - you can actually buy this as art on 20x200 - for example, http://www.20x200.com/artworks/2810-aaron-straup-cope-prettymaps-paris)\ufeff",

   "content": "The Impact of the Internet on Global Economic GrowthI was talking with +Brad Burnham the other day about the issues that the tech industry needs to get on the radar of Congress as we move forward into the inevitable next step in the SOPA/PIPA drama.  One concern I have about the current framing is that it appears to accept the copyright industry's assertion that piracy causes multi-billion dollar economic losses and kills jobs, and opposes it with non-economic issues like the risks to freedom around the world.  I've argued elsewhere based on my experience as a publisher that there are economic gains from the free flow of information on the internet, and that those gains far outweigh any losses to piracy, but I haven't seen that argument made as widely as I think it should be.  So I was very interested to learn, via +Hari Ravichandran, of a McKinsey Report from last year entitled Internet Matters:  The net's sweeping impact on growth, jobs, and prosperity.  From the executive summary:\"New McKinsey research into the Internet economies of the G-8 nations as well as Brazil, China, India, South Korea, and Sweden finds that the web accounts for a significant and growing portion of global GDP. Indeed, if measured as a sector, Internet-related consumption and expenditure is now bigger than agriculture or energy. On average, the Internet contributes 3.4 percent to GDP in the 13 countries covered by the research\u2014an amount the size of Spain or Canada in terms of GDP, and growing at a faster rate than that of Brazil.\"While the issues of freedom versus censorship are important, let's not leave the economic arguments to the pro-SOPA forces.  We know that Congress and the White House are rightly concerned about the economy, so let's make sure that the positive economic impact of the free flow of information via the Internet is also a key part of the discussion.You can download the full report at the link below.\ufeff",

But he does not. He goes on seeing less and less of its significance.\u201d This is so true in my experience. I've always felt that some of my success has been made possible by my ignorance.  When I first came to publishing, I knew nothing about it, and so I reinvented many things that others took for granted. Ditto with my ability to notice big patterns in technology: they came from a certain distance.  And there is example after example (politics comes to mind) where subject matter expertise is difficult to distinguish from deep ruts.That being said, there are many other cases where experts are indeed those to be trusted. Non-experts can often see the big picture; but experts help us to get the details right.  We need both fresh eyes and expertise.\ufeff",

   "content": "SOPA and PIPA are bad industrial policyThere are many arguments against SOPA and PIPA that are based on the potential harm they will do to the Internet. (There's a comprehensive outline of those arguments here https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/01/how-pipa-and-sopa-violate-white-house-principles-supporting-free-speech) At O'Reilly, we argue that they are also bad for the content industries that have proposed them, and bad industrial policy as a whole.  The term \"piracy\" implies that the wide availability of unauthorized copies of copyrighted content is the result of bad actors preying on the legitimate market. But history teaches us that it is primarily a result of market failure, the unwillingness or inability of existing companies to provide their product at a price or in a manner that potential customers want. In the 19th century, British authors like Charles Dickens and Anthony Trollope railed against piracy by American publishers, who republished their works by re-typesetting \"early sheets\" obtained by whatever method possible. Sometimes these works were authorized, sometimes not. In an 1862 letter to the Athenaeum, Fletcher Harper, co-founder of American publisher Harper Brothers, writing in reply to Anthony Trollope's complaint that his company had published an unauthorized edition of Trollope's novel Orley Farm, noted: \"In the absence of an international copyright, a system has grown up in this country which though it may not be perfect still secures to authors more money than any other system that can be devised in the present state of the law.... We cannot consent to its overthrow till some better plan shall have been devised.\"America went on to become the largest market in the world for copyrighted content.That is exactly the situation today. At O'Reilly, we have published ebooks DRM-free for the better part of two decades. We've watched the growth of this market from its halting early stages to its robust growth today. More than half of our ebook sales now come from overseas, in markets we were completely unable to serve in print.  While our books appear widely on unauthorized download sites, our legitimate sales are exploding. The greatest force in reporting unauthorized copies to us is our customers, who value what we do and want us to succeed. Yes, there is piracy, but our embrace of the internet's unparalleled ability to reach new customers \"though it may not be perfect still secures to authors more money than any other system that can be devised.\"The solution to piracy must be a market solution, not a government intervention, especially not one as ill-targeted as SOPA and PIPA. We already have laws that prohibit unauthorized resale of copyrighted material, and forward-looking content providers are developing products, business models, pricing, and channels that can and will eventually drive pirates out of business by making content readily available at a price consumers want to pay, and that ends up growing the market.Policies designed to protect industry players who are unwilling or unable to address unmet market needs are always bad policies. They retard the growth of new business models, and prop up inefficient companies. But in the end, they don't even help the companies they try to protect. Because those companies are trying to preserve old business models and pricing power rather than trying to reach new customers, they ultimately cede the market not to pirates but to legitimate players who have more fully embraced the new opportunity. We've already seen this story play out in the success of Apple and Amazon. While the existing music companies were focused on fighting file sharing, Apple went on to provide a compelling new way to buy and enjoy music, and became the largest music retailer in the world. While book publishers have been fighting the imagined threat of piracy, Amazon, not pirates, has become the biggest threat to their business by offering authors an alternative way to reach the market without recourse to their former gatekeepers.  Hollywood too, has a history of fighting technologies, such as the VCR, which developed into a larger market than the one the industry was originally trying to protect.In short, SOPA and PIPA not only harm the internet, they support existing content companies in their attempt to hold back innovative business models that will actually grow the market and deliver new value to consumers.\ufeff",

But they don\u2019t operate in isolation. They form a mosaic of powers under which our country could be considered, at least in part, authoritarian. Americans often proclaim our nation as a symbol of freedom to the world while dismissing nations such as Cuba and China as categorically unfree. Yet, objectively, we may be only half right. Those countries do lack basic individual rights such as due process, placing them outside any reasonable definition of \u201cfree,\u201d but the United States now has much more in common with such regimes than anyone may like to admit.\"These countries also have constitutions that purport to guarantee freedoms and rights. But their governments have broad discretion in denying those rights and few real avenues for challenges by citizens \u2014 precisely the problem with the new laws in this country.\"The list of powers acquired by the U.S. government since 9/11 puts us in rather troubling company.\"Here's a list of the issues discussed in the article:Assassination of U.S. citizensIndefinite detentionNo right to a civilian trialWarrantless searchesSecret EvidenceUS officials have immunity from War Crimes prosecutionSecret courts with secret evidenceImmunity from Judicial reviewContinuous monitoring of citizensExtraordinary renditionIt was easy to blame Bush for introducing these new powers in the anti-terrorist mania after 9/11. What's inexcusable is the way that President Obama's administration has extended these powers. Change indeed. The first politician who really stands for restoring freedom would make me abandon Obama in a heartbeat. Give me a politician of any party who will make a serious commitment to restoring our nation's commitment to freedom, and he or she will have my vote.The story ends with an appeal to our nation's storied history:\"The framers lived under autocratic rule and understood this danger better than we do. James Madison famously warned that we needed a system that did not depend on the good intentions or motivations of our rulers: 'If men were angels, no government would be necessary.'\"\"Benjamin Franklin was more direct. In 1787, a Mrs. Powel confronted Franklin after the signing of the Constitution and asked, 'Well, Doctor, what have we got \u2014 a republic or a monarchy?' His response was a bit chilling: 'A republic, Madam, if you can keep it.'\u201d\"Since 9/11, we have created the very government the framers feared: a government with sweeping and largely unchecked powers resting on the hope that they will be used wisely.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "This morning at Code for America, Jack Dangermond (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dangermond) founder of ESRI (and one of the pioneers of GIS) is giving an amazing talk about the origins of his business, complete with viewgraphs from 1972, which he scanned for us last night.He talked about the original problem he first confronted when working with the city of Los Angeles - disparate, disconnected databases containing environmental information, land records, engineering data, roads, administrative boundaries - that really belonged together, and the realization that the base map could  be a unifying framework for all that data.It wasn't just a technical problem - getting everything onto a single database platform - but also a conceptual one.  It seems obvious in retrospect, but realizing that this data, previously held in standard databases, would become more useful if viewed on a map, was a powerful advance. It strikes me that many advances are like this: we reframe a problem, and new possibilities unfold.Jack also talked about ESRI's current vision of working with government to provide a platform to open and share freely downloadable GIS data. One great line: \"National GIS will provide an 'information surface.'\"  Since ESRI software is widely used by government, this is a really valuable initiative.P.S. Jack also demonstrated his wonderful \"just do it\" spirit when +Jennifer Pahlka apologized for the loud industrial air conditioning, and said someone was coming to turn it off (the switch was up at the ceiling, on a large industrial unit). Jack said, \"I can do that now.\" He hopped up on the table, and flipped the kill switch.  It reminded me of one of my favorite stories about Samuel Johnson. On his visit with Boswell to the Hebrides, they came across an old man sitting in the shade of a huge oak. The man said \"I thought nothing of climbing this tree when I was a boy.\" Johnson, who was even older, kicked off his shoes, climbed the tree, and upon his descent, drawled, \"I thought nothing of it now.\"It's that spirit that has allowed Jack not just to invent a new field but to lead ESRI through four industry transitions, from mainframes to client server, to PCs, and now to the cloud. He's one of my heroes and role models.\ufeff",

   "content": "Before Solving a Problem, Make Sure You've Got the Right ProblemI was pleased to see the measured tone of the White House response to the citizen petition about  #SOPA  and  #PIPA  https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#/!/response/combating-online-piracy-while-protecting-open-and-innovative-internetand yet I found myself profoundly disturbed by something that seems to me to go to the root of the problem in Washington: the failure to correctly diagnose the problem we are trying to solve, but instead to accept, seemingly uncritically, the claims of various interest groups. The offending paragraph is as follows:\"Let us be clear\u2014online piracy is a real problem that harms the American economy, and threatens jobs for significant numbers of middle class workers and hurts some of our nation's most creative and innovative companies and entrepreneurs. It harms everyone from struggling artists to production crews, and from startup social media companies to large movie studios. While we are strongly committed to the vigorous enforcement of intellectual property rights, existing tools are not strong enough to root out the worst online pirates beyond our borders.\"In the entire discussion, I've seen no discussion of credible evidence of this economic harm. There's no question in my mind that piracy exists, that people around the world are enjoying creative content without paying for it, and even that some criminals are profiting by redistributing it. But is there actual economic harm?In my experience at O'Reilly, the losses due to piracy are far outweighed by the benefits of the free flow of information, which makes the world richer, and develops new markets for legitimate content. Most of the people who are downloading unauthorized copies of O'Reilly books would never have paid us for them anyway; meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of others are buying content from us, many of them in countries that we were never able to do business with when our products were not available in digital form.History shows us, again and again, that frontiers are lawless places, but that as they get richer and more settled, they join in the rule of law. American publishing, now the largest publishing industry in the world, began with piracy. (I have a post coming on that subject on Monday.)Congress (and the White House) need to spend time thinking hard about how best to grow our economy - and that means being careful not to close off the frontier, or to harm those trying to settle it, in order to protect those who want to remain safe at home. British publishers could have come to America in the 19th century; they chose not to, and as a result, we grew our own indigenous publishing industry, which relied at first, in no small part, on pirating British and European works.If the goal is really to support jobs and the American economy, internet \"protectionism\" is not the way to do it. It is said (though I've not found the source) that Einstein once remarked that if given 60 minutes to save the world, he would spend 55 of them defining the problem. And defining the problem means collecting and studying real evidence, not the overblown claims of an industry that has fought the introduction of every new technology that has turned out, in the end, to grow their business rather than threaten it.P.S. If Congress and the White House really want to fight pirates who are hurting the economy, they should be working to rein in patent trolls. There, the evidence of economic harm is clear, in multi-billion dollar transfers of wealth from companies building real products to those who have learned how to work the patent system while producing no value for consumers.P. P.S.

   "content": "Further thoughts on SOPA, and why Congress shouldn't listen to lobbyistsColleen Taylor of GigaOM interviewed me yesterday by phone on the subject of why I'm opposed to SOPA.  Rather than the usual comments about the potential harm to the internet, I focused on the harm to the very content industry that has proposed the law.  I highlighted three issues:Piracy is not the real problem. It's a symptom of market failureSOPA protects the wrong people. We need to encourage innovative businesses, not protect those who are unwilling to adapt to new technologySOPA ignores history.  Storied American publishers began as \"pirates\" in the eyes of the British, yet America grew up to be the largest copyright market in the world.Read the article: http://gigaom.com/2012/01/13/tim-oreilly-why-im-fighting-sopa/There was one point, though, that I wanted to expand on.  There was a section in the interview entitled \"Tech and lobbying don\u2019t mix\" that was too short, and effectively misrepresented my views by omitting a key part of my argument.  As published, the interview says:\"Certainly, the tech industry needs to do a lot more lobbying in Washington, DC. But the whole notion of lobbying is anathema to so many tech people, and for good reason. We\u2019re used to a world in which people design products that have a purpose, where your work speaks for itself. So yes, the tech industry should try to communicate more with the people in DC, but at the same time, congresspeople need to use more of their own independent judgement.\"These comments were in the context of a discussion of Congress' seeming to define its job as simply balancing the concerns of various constituencies, without seeming to use sufficient independent judgment about the accuracy of those concerns.For example, when I talked with +Nancy Pelosi at Mayor Ed Lee's inauguration on Sunday, she assured me that she was opposed to SOPA, but that the bill couldn't just be voted down because of the concerns of the movie industry.  I had this bizarre image of the Google Search Quality team meeting with content farms before rolling out the Panda search update to \"take into account their concerns.\"  In the end, Google was making changes that they knew were in the best interest of their users, and the fact that this would hurt the business of various companies producing low-quality content shouldn't (and presumably didn't) enter into the equation.My point is that when evaluating the request for legislation like SOPA, Congress ought to be considering factors like:* The credibility of those making claims. The motion picture industry has a history of opposing every new technology, even those that proved ultimately to grow the market.  (MPAA head Jack Valenti's claim that the VCR was the equivalent of letting \"Jack the Ripper\" into your home is the most famous example.)* The lack of independently verified quantitative evidence that there has been actual harm to the movie business (and other copyright businesses). My conversation with Representative Pelosi focused on my experience as a publisher at O'Reilly, in which losses to piracy are far outweighed by the growth of the market.  Far from being hurt by piracy, internet distribution of DRM-free ebooks is the brightest spot in my business, a key driver of growth.* The overall benefit to consumers in supporting innovative business models that increase access and bring down prices.This isn't a matter of simply weighing the concerns of one set of lobbyists against those of another, but using a standard of care and independent judgment about what is best for our society.If Congress isn't knowledgeable enough to make that determination, they need to be consulting independent experts, not lobbyists for one side or the other.The mismatch between Silicon Valley and Congress isn't just that Silicon Valley isn't engaged enough with lobbying Congress, but that Silicon Valley has this outmoded idea that your ideas succeed when they are right, as proven in the marketplace, rather than because you were better at making a backdoor deal than the next guy.Congress needs to act the same way, doing deep thinking and research about which policy approaches will best serve our country, rather than simply trying to balance the requests of various interest groups without regard to what is right.\ufeff",

(Interestingly, it echoes the words of Code for America fellow +Scott Silverman who said when he joined as a 2011 fellow, that his goal was to \"build interfaces to government that are simple, beautiful, and easy to use.\")Read the article, and every time you see the word \"liberal\" or \"democrat,\" substitute in your mind \"everyone we send to Washington.\" David has hit the nail on the head.\ufeff",

   "content": "Truly eye-opening:  According to a recent book, The Hedge Fund Mirage (http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118164318.html), by Simon Lack, from 1998 to 2010,  84% of the investment gains of the entire hedge fund industry went to the managers, and only 16% to the investors. The thievery of our \"financial industry\" beggars the mind.  Never mind the 1%!  This is a tiny fraction of the 1% fleecing the rest of the 1%.According to The Financial Times:http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c68c0250-379f-11e1-a5e0-00144feabdc0.html\"In fact, concludes Mr Lack, while many hedge fund managers have prospered from hefty fees, the bulk of their investment gains have not been shared with clients. On an asset-weighted basis, measuring cash invested to cash returned, hedge fund investors in aggregate, while narrowly beating the average return from equities, would have made more money over the past decade from investing in government bonds, and even from Treasury Bills.\"Of course the experience of 2008 colours these figures. According to Mr Lack, the hedge fund industry lost more money in that one year than all the profits it had generated during the previous 10 years. In fact most likely, he says, is that hedge funds lost more money for their investors in 2008 than the industry had made in its entire history. If true, that would put the industry up there with airlines and banks in the annals of long-term, non-productive performers from an investor perspective.\"Not that the managers have suffered the same way, of course. That is the brilliance of the hedge fund model. Between 1998 and 2010, the book shows, _even on favourable assumptions hedge fund managers earned an estimated $379bn in fees, out of total investment gains (before fees) of $449bn. In other words, they took 84 per cent of the investment profits their funds made, leaving just 16 per cent for the investors.\"Once you make adjustments for survivorship bias, fund of funds fees and so on, it is probable, he suggests, that hedge fund managers have kept all the money made, and investors have in aggregate received nothing_.\" [italics mine]\ufeff",

   "content": "The Ruby of Crested ButteOver the new year, I went skiing in Crested Butte, CO. I'm a beginner, so it didn't bother me that only some of the runs were open. I had a lovely time learning to ski, and definitely want to go back. The mountains are amazing and the skiing is great. There's good food in town, too.But even more, what I wanted to write about here was the place I stayed, a B&amp;B called The Ruby. http://therubyofcrestedbutte.com The picture below is the view from my room. That should say enough. Following that is a picture of Chris, the co-owner, host, and cook at the Ruby. His breakfasts are amazing - absolutely delicious and enough to keep you going all day.But more than that, I've never had an innkeeper go so far above and beyond. My mac power supply went belly up just as I arrived. Chris loaned me his own, and went out of his way when shopping in Gunnison (half an hour away) to see if he could find me a new one there. His efforts were so above and beyond to put him forever in my hotel hall of fame list.Fantastic skiing, fantastic town, and a fantastic place to stay. There's a reason tripadvisor picked it as the #1 place to stay in Crested Butte (and the #2 place in all of Colorado)\ufeff",

Set aside.Cook onions, zucchini, and carrots in the oil over medium heat until onion is golden, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Add the lamb and increase heat to medium high, and cook till brown, about 6 minutes. Pour off excess fat.Add the broth, currants, tomato paste, oregano, cumin, and cinnamon, and stir till tomato paste is dissolved.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until liquid almost completely reduces, but meat is still moist, about 10 minutes. Serve over rice.  Wild rice is excellent.\ufeff",

   "content": "Vint Cerf observes that Internet Access Is Not a Human RightThoughtful op-ed in @newyorktimes from an unexpected source - Vint Cerf: Internet Access Is Not a Human Right \"FROM the streets of Tunis to Tahrir Square and beyond, protests around the world last year were built on the Internet and the many devices that interact with it. Though the demonstrations thrived because thousands of people turned out to participate, they could never have happened as they did without the ability that the Internet offers to communicate, organize and publicize everywhere, instantaneously.It is no surprise, then, that the protests have raised questions about whether Internet access is or should be a civil or human right. The issue is particularly acute in countries whose governments clamped down on Internet access in an attempt to quell the protesters. In June, citing the uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa, a report by the United Nations\u2019 special rapporteur went so far as to declare that the Internet had \u201cbecome an indispensable tool for realizing a range of human rights.\u201d Over the past few years, courts and parliaments in countries like France and Estonia have pronounced Internet access a human right.But that argument, however well meaning, misses a larger point: technology is an enabler of rights, not a right itself. There is a high bar for something to be considered a human right. Loosely put, it must be among the things we as humans need in order to lead healthy, meaningful lives, like freedom from torture or freedom of conscience. It is a mistake to place any particular technology in this exalted category, since over time we will end up valuing the wrong things. For example, at one time if you didn\u2019t have a horse it was hard to make a living. But the important right in that case was the right to make a living, not the right to a horse. Today, if I were granted a right to have a horse, I\u2019m not sure where I would put it.\"Read the whole thing. It's refreshing to see such a nuanced and thoughtful take on an issue like this.\ufeff",

The AAP and the authors of the bill claim that this bill is to prevent \"government interference\" in the activities of scholarly and research publishers. What doublespeak! What the bill actually targets are efforts by agencies such as the NIH to mandate open access to research that is funded by the government. In other words, stop the government from \"interfering\" with our privatization and monopolistic exploitation of government-funded research.

When Palin said that, she should have been officially cast-off by senior, principled members of her party.  But instead, they embraced the rhetoric. What's so odd to me is that many of the principles of the GOP are correct, but they are misapplied. Government is too big, too intrusive, and many of its programs are misguided.  Yet the GOP, which should be championing this kind of rational approach to cutting costs in healthcare, is the party that took it off the table.Ditto with cutting our bloated security apparatus. It's the supposed party of small government that gave us the DHS, and wants our massive defense spending to go untouched.If there are Republicans among you who don't want to be tarred with that brush, please stand up and start talking about what it would really take to achieve smaller government.  It's not cutting basic social services and the real safety net.I don't think of myself as a Democrat or a liberal.  I think I'm part of the real middle that is tired of the posturing and the extremes of both parties (while all the while both are captured by the interests of big businesses.)We need someone who is gutsy enough to tackle the country's problems, whichever side of the political divide those problems fall on, and not just those that fit neatly on one side of the current political rhetoric.Alas, we don't have a candidate like that in either party.\ufeff",

This is true above all in the realm of energy. The United States doesn't need exotic biofuels or balloon-borne wind turbines. Its real problems are wasteful private energy use and the near-total absence of effective, down-to-earth, long-term policies.\"Energy use is merely a means to many rewarding ends: economic security, education, health. The United States consumes nearly twice as much energy per capita as the richest countries of the European Union, which raises the question: What has it gotten in return? Are Americans twice as rich as the French? Are they twice as educated as the Germans? Do they live twice as long as the Swedes? Are they twice as happy as the Danes or twice as safe as the Dutch? The obvious answer for all of the above is no; indeed, many of America's quality-of-life indicators -- including infant mortality, longevity, and educational achievement -- do not even rank among the world's top 10!...\"The parallels with America's great public-health epidemic of obesity are inescapable. Even after throwing away some 40 percent of its abundant food supply, the United States still has the industrialized world's most overweight population. America similarly produces more energy per capita than any other major rich economy -- so much so that if the United States were to consume that energy at a rate comparable to Germany or France, it would be a massive energy exporter. Instead, America imports more than 25 percent of its energy, paying more than $2 trillion for the privilege over the past decade -- and still ends up with little to show for it. The United States now faces the choice of curbing its energy appetite with deliberation, commitment, and foresight, or waiting for the unraveling economy to put it on a painful crash diet.\"\ufeff",

No sooner does the book come out than there's a wonderful essay in the New York Times by +Pico Iyer on much the same theme. Clay's book is practical; Pico's essay is lyrical and historical:\"The urgency of slowing down \u2014 to find the time and space to think \u2014 is nothing new, of course, and wiser souls have always reminded us that the more attention we pay to the moment, the less time and energy we have to place it in some larger context. \u201cDistraction is the only thing that consoles us for our miseries,\u201d the French philosopher Blaise Pascal wrote in the 17th century, \u201cand yet it is itself the greatest of our miseries.\u201d He also famously remarked that all of man\u2019s problems come from his inability to sit quietly in a room alone.\"When telegraphs and trains brought in the idea that convenience was more important than content \u2014 and speedier means could make up for unimproved ends \u2014 Henry David Thoreau reminded us that \u201cthe man whose horse trots a mile in a minute does not carry the most important messages.\u201d Even half a century ago, Marshall McLuhan, who came closer than most to seeing what was coming, warned, \u201cWhen things come at you very fast, naturally you lose touch with yourself.\u201d Thomas Merton struck a chord with millions, by not just noting that \u201cMan was made for the highest activity, which is, in fact, his rest,\u201d but by also acting on it, and stepping out of the rat race and into a Cistercian cloister.\"Read the whole thing. It's worth your time.\ufeff",

I particularly like the ending, which speaks to the true nature of being an entrepreneur.\"There are many of us who consider ourselves to be entrepreneurs, inventors, and startup guys and gals, but I think this quote from Jobs captures the essence that there are no shortcuts to greatness. Greatness is dedication. It's a demand, and it's a detail. Or, as Jobs said:\"'I hate it when people call themselves entrepreneurs when what they're really trying to do is launch a startup and then sell or go public so they can cash in and move on. They're unwilling to do the work it takes to build a real company, which is the hardest work in business.'\"\ufeff",

   "content": "I really like +John Tolva's piece about open government in Chicago. It ties together the key themes in what we started out calling \"Gov 2.0\" (transparency, and government data as a platform) with key ideas for making government better. It starts out with four key principles, and then shows how they are being applied in Chicago:\"Transparency builds trust.Accountability builds a better workforce.Analysis builds new processes.Open data builds businesses.\"I haven't seen a better definition of my idea of government as a platform than John's. It's simple and clear:\"There are a variety of ways to work with the data in the City\u2019s portal, but the most flexible use comes from accessing it via the official API (application programming interface). Developers can hook into the portal and receive a continuously-updated stream of data without manually refreshing their applications each time changes happen in the feed. This changes the City from a static provider of data to a kind of platform for a application development. It\u2019s a reconceptualization of government not as provider of end user experience (i.e., the app or service itself), but as the provider of the foundation for others to build upon. Think of an operating system\u2019s relationship to the applications that third-party developers create for it.\"I also love the focus on the use of data for process improvement. Companies like Google measure everything, and build processes that respond in real time to that data. It sounds like Chicago is moving in that direction. I'm really impressed.\ufeff",

Or picture the team\u2019s quarterback standing up in the postgame press conference and apologizing for having only won by 3 points when the final betting spread was 9 points in his team\u2019s favor. While it\u2019s laughable to imagine coaches or quarterbacks doing so, CEOs are expected to do both of these things.\u201dthen transposes it to the world of business:\"In today\u2019s paradoxical world of maximizing shareholder value, which Jack Welch himself has called \u201cthe dumbest idea in the world\u201d, the situation is the reverse. CEOs and their top managers have massive incentives to focus most of their attentions on the expectations market, rather than the real job of running the company producing real products and services.The \u201creal market,\u201d Martin explains, is the world in which factories are built, products are designed and produced, real products and services are bought and sold, revenues are earned, expenses are paid, and real dollars of profit show up on the bottom line. That is the world that executives control\u2014at least to some extent.The expectations market is the world in which shares in companies are traded between investors\u2014in other words, the stock market. In this market, investors assess the real market activities of a company today and, on the basis of that assessment, form expectations as to how the company is likely to perform in the future. The consensus view of all investors and potential investors as to expectations of future performance shapes the stock price of the company.\u201cWhat would lead [a CEO],\u201d asks Martin, \u201cto do the hard, long-term work of substantially improving real-market performance when she can choose to work on simply raising expectations instead? Even if she has a performance bonus tied to real-market metrics, the size of that bonus now typically pales in comparison with the size of her stock-based incentives. Expectations are where the money is. And of course, improving real-market performance is the hardest and slowest way to increase expectations from the existing level.\u201d\ufeff",

Via +lorcan dempsey on the Reading 2.0 mailing list.http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2011/1231/1224309666607.html\"Television was unsettling because it is both public and intimate. There was nothing strange about the idea of two-dimensional, lifelike moving images: films had been around for a long time. But TV brought those images into the private, domestic space. It became, as the Catholic primate Cardinal D\u2019Alton warned on the opening night, \u201centrenched in our homes\u201d. And it did so in a way that undermined certainties about what is or is not \u201creal\u201d.\"A man from rural Co Westmeath told me of his grandmother in the early days of TV in Ireland. Her daughter encouraged her to get undressed for bed before the fire, where it was warm. But she wouldn\u2019t do so until the television was turned off: how could her modesty survive the prying eyes behind the screen?\"I remember my own grandfather, who came from rural Co Wexford, and who lived with us. He had two heroes: de Valera and anyone wearing the colours of the Wexford hurling team. But he acquired another: Marcus Welby, MD. The eponymous avuncular doctor on the American drama series was, to him, a magical and saintly healer, whose patients always recovered. He did not regard Welby as a fictional character.This was not just a matter of naivety. Television was a new language that had to be learned....\"Also lovely:\" Indigenous television came late to the Republic. The technology had been viable since the 1930s: James Joyce was one of the first major writers to notice television, referring to it in Finnegans Wake as the \u201cbairdboard bombardment screen\u201d (after its pioneer John Logie Baird) and astutely defining it as a \u201cverbivocovisual\u201d medium.......\ufeff",

(Verge is focused on the convergence of energy, information, buildings, and transportation.)Particularly fascinating to me were the comments from a couple of the participants regarding the role of the military.\"One of the big players in VERGE -- arguably, the biggest -- will be the U.S. military, which already is aggressively pursuing a range of technologies that fall under the VERGE umbrella. Which makes perfect sense: military bases are, in effect, self-contained cities that need efficient and reliable power, and for which waste and inefficiency hamper their critical mission. The Defense Department has initiated a number of programs piloting intelligent buildings, microgrids powered by a diversity of renewable and nonrenewable energy resources, energy storage technologies, self-driving vehicles, and more.\"One of the participants in the session quoted a military planner as saying \"We don't want to be islands of light in a sea of darkness.\"  Now that's a thought: military bases as the equivalent of the Irish monasteries in a future dark age!\ufeff",

   "content": "Publishers Finally Starting to Wake Up to the Consequences of an Amazon ebook MonopolyThere's an interesting article in Publisher's Weekly about the fear and outrage among publishers as Amazon starts to turn the screws in demanding additional \"co op marketing fees\" for Kindle titles, as well as additional discount.http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/49874-is-amazon-pushing-publishers-to-brink-on-terms-co-op-.htmlAccording to the article:\"Publishers and distributors have called the latest negotiations with Amazon the most adversarial to date, and many have noted that, for the first time, the retailer is outlining co-op costs for digital, as well as print. Amazon has, as some sources explained, long been pressuring publishers to provide ancillary content on the pages where their books are sold, from videos and q&amp;a's to links to similar books. That content has always been something publishers have had to both pay for and provide. In the latest negotiations with Amazon, sources told PW, the price of providing that content has jumped to what sources say are astronomical percentages (but those sources would not provide specific numbers)....\"Although publishers fear seeing their titles disappear from Amazon--for many in the industry the retailer accounts for 20% to 25% of their business--some say the demands the retailer is making are impossible to meet and would nearly wipe out all of their profits there anyway....\"More problematically, for many in the industry, the latest talks with Amazon are being described as less of a dialogue than a dictation of terms. As one source explained, the talks have boiled down to \"what publishers can do for Amazon, and not what Amazon can do for publishers.\" Most ironically, the new terms would allow Amazon to continue to gain market share as it always has: driving book prices down. As one source put it: \"If Amazon wants to improve its margins, it should cut back on the discounting.\"I've seen for a long time where Amazon is headed, towards a Walmart-like status where it can dictate whatever terms it likes to the publishing industry. And that was why I was amazed at the train-wreck of short-term thinking that led to the Google Books lawsuit by the Association of American Publishers and the Author's Guild. Faced with the threat of a future monopoly by a ruthless competitor as pbooks transition to ebooks, a potential white knight arrives on the scene...and the publishers promptly sue the white knight!  And as a result, though no one is saying it out loud, Google has quietly de-prioritized its efforts and abandoned the publishers to their fate.Fortunately, Apple is still in the game with iBooks (and at O'Reilly, we're seeing nice traction there, though it's still a small fraction of the sales on the Kindle), and the Barnes & Noble Nook is successful enough that it will likely survive the potential demise of its brick-and-mortar parent. (Walmart Nook, anyone?)  And of course, smart publishers are learning to sell direct.  (At O'Reilly, our own direct ebook sales are our strongest single channel.)But there's no question that trouble lies ahead for existing publishers. One interesting question that remains is whether Amazon will recognize the tipping point of market share where they have to start acting like a responsible monopoly or attract the attention of the Justice Dept. (Microsoft learned that lesson too late.)  Unlike Walmart, which can play as tough as it likes because despite its size it will never have a monopoly on retail, there's a credible case that Amazon is closing in on a de-facto monopoly in ebooks, and will have to abandon its predatory pricing on ebooks (below cost in some cases) or face legal scrutiny.I hope they do take a lesson from Stan Lee and realize that \"with great power comes great responsibility.\" Amazon is a great company, and has moved the industry (more than one industry!) forward in countless ways, just as Microsoft did before them. But it takes an even greater company to know when its market share is large enough that it has to start playing by different rules, and start preserving an ecosystem rather than consuming it. I'm not sure we're there yet, but that day is definitely coming.Meanwhile, publishers need to focus on new ways to create value for readers and for authors, as well as new ways to reach them, and stop focusing on how to preserve the business they used to enjoy.\ufeff",

I hate the way he's been pandering to the right wing, but I have to say that his personal thriftiness really resonates with me.I love these bits:\"Tagg Romney, Mr. Romney\u2019s eldest son, explains his father this way: \u201cThere isn\u2019t much that bothers him more than wasting money.\u201d\"Thrift was a family virtue. Ann Romney used to cut her sons\u2019 hair in the backyard. Her husband would tackle home renovations himself. Once, he enlisted everyone \u2014 for six weekends straight \u2014 in building a fence around their large home in Massachusetts. A Mitt mantra, recalled Spencer Zwick, a family friend, was, \u201cJust because you can afford something doesn\u2019t mean you should buy it.\u201dIt's a charming story, well worth reading. I wish the authors had gone on from the personal to evaluate how well he applied his personal mix of wealth and frugality to his stint as governor of Massachusetts.\ufeff",

   "content": "Of all the things @oreillymedia does, donating books to developing countries may be the most rewarding, as demonstrated in the attached blog post from +Rob Faludi:\"O\u2019Reilly Media and the Network Startup Resource Center (NSRC) facilitated a generous donation of 30 copies of my book \u201cBuilding Wireless Sensor Networks\u201d for the \u201cFirst West African Workshop on Wireless Sensor Networks\u201d at Accra, the University of Ghana.\"We first started doing book donations to developing back in the 90s when I was on the board of the Internet Society at the urging of +Larry Landweber and +George Sadowsky in conjunction with the INET Developing Country Workshops.  It's one thing to know intellectually that virtually all of the countries added to the internet through the 90s had it done by graduates of these workshops, but most of all, I remember the emotional impact. I still remember the chills I got hearing the cheers from the attendees of the Developing Country workshop in Montreal back in the 90s. It was so clear that getting books, and technical knowledge, meant so much.From that point on, we made an effort to donate books returned by Borders and Barnes & Noble (which were not possible to resell because of the stickers they'd added) to folks in countries where our books were unavailable or unaffordable. We found a great outlet for this through the Network Startup Resource Center at the University of Oregon, which is run by +Steven Huter .  Fortunately, due to ebooks, we've solved the availability problem (we sell ebooks in places where we had no ability to sell print books), but donations can still help BTW, 2012 is the 20th anniversary of the NSRC and it would be great to see other tech companies supporting their work on tech knowledge dissemination, and building the net around the world. http://www.nsrc.org\ufeff",

I'm increasingly seeing (as are others) that the labor market of the 21st century is going to be so thoroughly transformed as to be unrecognizable. As +Paul Saffo said to me over dinner the other night, \"\"Figuring out what will replace the job is the great challenge of the next 30 years.\"  (One great challenge anyway, as there will be many.)For more on the idea that the job as we knew it is increasingly under attack by new technology, see +Andrew McAfee and +Eric Brynjolfsson's ebook, Race Against the Machine. http://www.amazon.com/Race-Against-Machine-Accelerating-ebook/dp/B005WTR4ZI\ufeff",

   "content": "Power in Numbers: China Aims for High-Tech PrimacyInteresting NY Times article by David Barboza and +John Markoff about China, IPv6, and the future of computing. What I find striking about it is the kind of concerted industrial strategy (vs. the faith in \"two guys in a garage\") that led to China's dominance in solar panels, which I wrote about earlier this year ( https://plus.google.com/107033731246200681024/posts/5eQacBJD5wA ) in discussing the collapse of Solyndra in light of what I'd learned from +jack hidary about the way China had relied on industrial coordination rather than innovation to bring down prices and dominate the market.Here's a bit of that thinking from the article:\"Never mind that there may be no Chinese Steve Jobs, said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute.\u201cThere are different kinds of innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tend to equate innovation with companies that start from garages based on brainstorms.\u201cThere is another kind of innovation that results in constant improvement that we are not good at \u2014 and they are.\u201d\ufeff",

   "content": "Outside Seville Cathedral there is a set of \"Popup shops\" selling nothing but the makings for incredible Christmas creches. At first I thought they were a blight on the square before the Cathedral, but the more I looked, the more I found them to be a marvel. We spent about an hour admiring the ingenuity and the variety. If you're serious about your Christmas creche, this is the place to be.  You could spend hundreds, if not thousands of euros here if this were your kind of thing.I have no idea when they open, and when they close up shop, but they were clearly seasonal and temporary. (It reminds me how great it would be to have better lists of festivals and other seasonal information for travel around the world.  While in Spain, I also heard about great Easter Week processions in Granada and thereabouts.)The range of miniatures is amazing - not just the usual shepherds and wise men, but villagers - nay, whole villages - houses, vegetables growing in fields, bread, clothes, and pottery on the shelves of shops, animals of every kind.\ufeff",

   "content": "Got a new Galaxy Nexus phone (thanks! +Sundar Pichai) and am just loving it. It has the best \"hand feel\" of any phone I've ever encountered.  It's big, with a bright, clear screen, but incredibly light. Much lighter than my Nexus S, which I dearly loved, but am already not missing.The ice-cream sandwich UI has so many enhancements I can't begin to list them all. I love the new way address book searches are presented; I like the new windows button on the bottom button bar (though I miss the menu button, which has now migrated to being a softkey at different places in various apps); I like the app folders.  I also like the way it auto-detects wifi and lets you log in without having to go down into settings.  I'm sure I'll discover more great features as I go along.The camera is great. The lack of zoom was the one thing I really didn't like about the Nexus S camera; that's fixed here.  It even does panoramas.And of course, I love the way the phone becomes yours simply by logging in. Almost everything comes over automatically.  (You lose your text message history, and your call history.)  This, of course, assumes that you've set your phone to be automatically backed up to the cloud.  Oddly, while your apps are remembered and automatically reloaded, the phone doesn't remember what you had on the home screen, so you do have to move them back there.  And oddly, at least two of my apps didn't make it over: foursquare and google voice.  However, it was the work of a moment to reload them.In short, I haven't been as pleased with a new device since I got my original iphone. Google and Samsung really nailed this one.\ufeff",

I've made this point myself a lot to publishers, but Joe Esposito makes it very clear here:\"But the lesson of Borders is not about the advent of new businesses and threats; nor is it about the many mistakes made by the Borders management, so many that you can only shake your head in wonder.  (The saga of Borders is beautifully chronicled in Business Week.)  The real thing to take from Borders\u2019 collapse is that the old infrastructure will not always be there. In one stroke trade publishers lost a huge chunk of their distribution network. That network was not simply sitting around patiently, waiting for publishers to get their digital game plan ready. The distribution network collapsed before the publishers were ready and suddenly unleashed a number of forces for which no publisher was truly prepared.\"I like to think O'Reilly was more prepared than most, but the disruption isn't yet over. The lesson I've been trying to get across, which Joe also hammers on, is that the mechanisms for print to be distributed to customers may go away before the demand is completely gone.  Business is an ecosystem.  During the transition, the costs of manufacturing and distributing print books will be going up at the same time as the infrastructure for delivering them goes down.The print book will likely be going the way of the LP and the CD and the DVD in far fewer years than most people understand.\ufeff",

   "content": "Fantastic article about Minneapolis that echoes what +Jennifer Pahlka of @codeforamerica said in her recent TedX Philly talk [video not posted yet] about the importance of cities in dealing with the problems that actually face most citizens: \u201cCity governments are the last standing functional form of government in the United States and possibly the world,\u201d says [Minneapolis Mayor] Rybak, who was 13 when he decided he wanted to be mayor.I particularly loved this bit in the article: \"there is no Republican or Democratic way to pick up the garbage. And because you have to be able to perform. When somebody calls 911 and needs a police officer, you have to send a police officer. If a water line breaks in front of somebody\u2019s house, it has to be fixed. It isn\u2019t policy, it is doing the work. And that\u2019s what city government is all about.\"Of course, city government is not without its problems. Unions, outdated procurement rules, and ignorance of the new possibilities of technology often leave cities behind the curve when it comes to 21st century services. And that's what codeforamerica.org is all about: getting smart technologists to give a year of service to help build 21st century services in cities that just want to do the job that their citizens need.A big part of that is building services that help the people to help themselves. As Mayor Rybak says in the article:\u201cIt would have been a lot of fun to be a mayor during the Great Society, where you could write a big fat check and make something happen,\u201d Rybak says. \u201cNow you have to bring your resources to the table. Very few mayors can solve any major problems on their own. You must bring what the city has to offer and inspire people from other levels of government, the private sector, business and residents to come together. There are close to 400,000 people living in 60 square miles here, and my job is to figure out a way to get them to do as much of the work together as possible.\u201dvia +Andrew McLaughlin\ufeff",

   "content": "Police Brutality at UC DavisThis piece about police brutality at the Occupy protests at UC Davis is a sad reminder of how lightly many in the US hold the values of free expression that our country was founded on. The opening photo in the story below reminds me of Hannah Arendt's comments about \"the banality of evil.\" You wonder whether these people think when they look at the photos and videos of their actions, and what they think about the judgment of history. I remember 30 years ago, we all watched Richard Attenborough's Gandhi and wondered how the British could have committed the atrocities they did. (The memory of the scene in which the protesters march up to the factory gate two by two, expecting and enduring the moment when they will be clubbed down, still brings a lump to my throat.) Now we know.As +Keith Fahlgren (@abdelazer) said on Twitter:  \"YouTube sure makes it easy to hate the police.\"  And that's a terrible thing for a society, when those whose job it is to protect the values of our society turn against it.There's a moving and courageous denunciation of the actions by the UC Davis administration by an assistant professor there that is well worth a read:http://bicyclebarricade.wordpress.com/2011/11/19/open-letter-to-chancellor-linda-p-b-katehi/After a detailed description of what happened, Nathan Brown focuses on the cognitive dissonance between the statements of the university and its actions:\"On Wednesday November 16, you issued a letter by email to the campus community. In this letter, you discussed a hate crime which occurred at UC Davis on Sunday November 13. In this letter, you express concern about the safety of our students. You write, \u201cit is particularly disturbing that such an act of intolerance should occur at a time when the campus community is working to create a safe and inviting space for all our students.\u201d You write, \u201cwhile these are turbulent economic times, as a campus community, we must all be committed to a safe, welcoming environment that advances our efforts to diversity and excellence at UC Davis.\u201d\"I will leave it to my colleagues and every reader of this letter to decide what poses a greater threat to \u201ca safe and inviting space for all our students\u201d or \u201ca safe, welcoming environment\u201d at UC Davis: 1) Setting up tents on the quad in solidarity with faculty and students brutalized by police at UC Berkeley? or 2) Sending in riot police to disperse students with batons, pepper-spray, and tear-gas guns, while those students sit peacefully on the ground with their arms linked? Is this what you have in mind when you refer to creating \u201ca safe and inviting space?\u201d Is this what you have in mind when you express commitment to \u201ca safe, welcoming environment?\u201d\"I am writing to tell you in no uncertain terms that there must be space for protest on our campus. There must be space for political dissent on our campus. There must be space for civil disobedience on our campus. There must be space for students to assert their right to decide on the form of their protest, their dissent, and their civil disobedience\u2014including the simple act of setting up tents in solidarity with other students who have done so. There must be space for protest and dissent, especially, when the object of protest and dissent is police brutality itself. You may not order police to forcefully disperse student protesters peacefully protesting police brutality. You may not do so. It is not an option available to you as the Chancellor of a UC campus. That is why I am calling for your immediate resignation.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "Love this piece from DelanceyPlace, which was brought to my attention by +Peter Bennett (@hablantia), which puts the mania for copyright control in perspective, by looking at how American book publishing from the 1830s to the 1860s was also a turbulent time.\"With the current explosion of blogs and other writings on the internet, some people lament the unchecked libel, plagiarism, and lack of fact-checking - and hold printed newspapers, magazines and books as examples of responsible behavior. Yet similar charges were being made against printed publications in the 1800s.\" The piece follows with an excerpt from the book The Fabrication of American Literature: Fraudulence and Antebellum Print Culture by Lara Langer Cohen, published by University of Pennsylvania Press.  Here is an excerpt from the excerpt:\"A rapid succession of technological and economic innovations in the early nineteenth century transformed the early republican period's largely artisanal print shops into a major commercial industry. Improvements to the flat-bed press in the 1810s and 1820s, the introduction of horsepower in the 1820s and steam power a few years later, and the invention of the cylinder press in the 1830s greatly sped up production rates, as did the development of the stereotyping and electrotyping processes in the 1810s and 1840s, respectively. Former hand processes like paper and board manufacturing, typesetting, and binding were swiftly mechanized. By 1830 a single machine could make paper on rolls (rather than sheet by sheet, as hand production required) and cut it to size.   \"The introduction in the 1820s of cased bindings, covers assembled separately and then sewn to the printed pages, was especially transformative. In the past, publishers had generally issued books in paper wrappers or pasteboard covers, which readers then had bound as they chose or could afford. Cased bindings allowed publishers to issue books in uniform editions with fixed prices. For sure sellers, publishers would produce books in multiple bindings, each tailored to different tastes and budgets; thus in 1856 a reader looking for Irving's Sketch-Book could buy an edition bound in cloth for $1.25, with illustrations and gilt decoration for $2.25, or in elegant morocco covers for $3.50....\"The unmoored claims of the printed book elicited constant questions from its very beginnings: Was it a 'true copy' or did it misrepresent the manuscript, intentionally or unintentionally? Did the author named really write it? Was it the kind of text its title purported it to be? Could its contents be trusted? Moreover, the print culture of the early nineteenth-century United States possessed a peculiar volatility all its own: it was a 'culture of reprinting,' in Meredith McGill's words, in which 'circulation outstripped authorial and editorial control.' ... In the whirl of reprinting, no text was fixed. Magazine editors regularly republished each other's articles, British and American 'bookaneers' competed to issue first editions on each shore or undersell existing editions, and writers often found their words altered, cut, rearranged, or attributed to others, or had unfamiliar words attributed to them. Printed texts cited, commented upon, and reappropriated each other to an extent that compares with the most viral internet meme. ...\"\ufeff",

It may be too geeky for the mainstream, but for anyone who is at all tech-savvy, it's smart and insightful, pulling key principles into an easily understood framework.http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/11/a-guide-to-the-occupy-wall-street-api-or-why-the-nerdiest-way-to-think-about-ows-is-so-useful/248562/Alexis starts out:\"The most fascinating thing about Occupy Wall Street is the way that the protests have spread from Zuccotti Park to real and virtual spaces across the globe. Metastatic, the protests have an organizational coherence that's surprising for a movement with few actual leaders and almost no official institutions. Much of that can be traced to how Occupy Wall Street has functioned in catalyzing other protests. Local organizers can choose from the menu of options modeled in Zuccotti, and adapt them for local use. Occupy Wall Street was designed to be mined and recombined, not simply copied.\"This idea crystallized for me yesterday when Jonathan Glick, a long-time digital journalist, tweeted, \"I think #OWS was working better as an API than a destination site anyway.\" If you get the idea, go ahead and skip ahead to the documentation below. If you don't get, let me explain why it might be the most useful way of thinking about #Occupy.\"A thoughtful take, worth spreading.\ufeff",

There is a LOT of unexpected behavior.  And in the old days, when I discovered a new behavior in Mac OS X, I was usually delighted.  They'd thought of something \"just right\" and the behavior, once discovered, was natural and obvious in retrospect.But in Lion, unexpected behavior is confusing and wrong. Frankly, I felt that way about Mac OS 9. The once beautiful, simple and intuitive interface had become baroque and unintuitive. It only made sense if you'd become accustomed to its peculiarities.  Mac OS X was refreshing and simple once again.  But by Lion, it's full of contradictions.\ufeff",

The single volume of facts that has been most indispensable to me for over a half century is the Statistical Abstract of the United States.Despite a storied existence of some 130 years, the Obama Administration\u2014which thinks nothing of blowing a half billion dollars on untried solar-power companies or hundreds of billions bailing out politically well-connected firms like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae\u2014cannot find the dollars to fund an extraordinary valuable research tool. Need to know quickly the growth in natural-gas production, trends in violent crime, the number of bank failures, or the number of days the sun shines in New York relative to Miami? Go to the Statistical Abstract. It is my Bible, my Talmud, my Quran. It is everything.\"\ufeff",

I'm starting to hate Mac OS X, and thinking there's starting to be an opportunity for a new, simple, clean OS to come along.Right now, since I've switched to Gmail, I'm trying to back up and remove from my machine years of accumulated mail storage from mail.app. First obstacle: a user's library files are now hidden. Finally find them (thanks Matt Silver), back up the files to an external disk, and then delete them. But then when I empty the trash, an ungodly number of files--going back years--claim they are \"in use\" and can't be deleted.  So here I am having to click \"continue\" every few thousand files (if I'm lucky) as I page through more than 400,00 files to be deleted.  I know this is actually an old mis-feature - but why the devil wouldn't they give you an \"ignore\" checkbox or a \"delete whatever you can checkbox\"?  This has been a problem for years, but never fixed, while they add new gloss all the time.  But that's just the latest frustration. There are so many things that are worse in Lion than in Snow Leopard, just as there were many things worse in Snow Leopard than in Leopard, and on back.Time to start over, guys.\ufeff",

   "content": "Saw the @OReillyMedia#Ebook Deal/Day for the Python and AWS Cookbook http://oreil.ly/uOmr8L , which made me think a bit about how much new media drives new formats. The Cookbook format for technical books was created by +Nat Torkington and +Tom Christiansen  back in 1998 or so, for The Perl Cookbook http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565922433.doLike Unix Power Tools, http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596003302.do the book I created in 1993 with the help of Jerry Peek and +Mike Loukides, the Cookbook format was a response to a new medium. The simple problem/solution/explanation format - i.e. programming \"recipes\" for a host of problems large and small - is both an ideal online reference format, and a just in time learning format, that is optimized for the \"get me what I need, quick\" learning approach of the web. What's interesting is that these books were created in a print format, because that's what we knew how to monetize at the time.Community-generated sites like StackOverflow have since filled in much of that gap online, but there's still enormous value in curation. Even Wikipedia has editors. There's value in the structured format of Cookbook entries, just as there is in the structured format of wikipedia entries, as well as in a filter that says \"this one has been vetted; this one shows the best way to solve that particular problem; this is an important problem that you might not even have thought about.\"We created an online workflow for creating community-driven Cookbooks with ActiveState for The Python Cookbook http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007973.do (now rebranded as simply http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/ ). We had thousands of recipes submitted, and chose the best for editorial development and publication in the print book.But we never generalized it into a platform, as we should have done. Ideally, there would be an online community around each of these books, and they would be living databases with periodic print or ebook incarnations for those who want them.If you'd be interested in being part of a programming recipe community, let us know. They are one of the new book formats I've been proudest of. But increasingly, in the online world, the book is not a product, it's a conversation. And what's important about this format is that it allows us to focus a community on conversations on the best ways to get various things done. It's easy to think that O'Reilly products for programmers are about getting better at coding or software engineering or design, but there's a subtle difference when you realize that it's about getting better as coders or software engineers or designers. One places focus on the artifact, the other on the maker.In the meantime, check out the new Python and AWS Cookbook and let me know what you think.\ufeff",

Previous competitions have used data in areas ranging from particle physics to customer relations. This year, they're looking for something particularly meaningful: a data problem in an area such as medicine, education, the environment, or anything that leads to a social good.The deadline is approaching, and they're still looking for good candidates The competition will be hosted by Kaggle, so if your submission wins, you don't have to worry about logistics; all you need to do is supply the data, and one or two well-defined problems that you expect the data to solve. Then sit back and wait for the solutions to roll in.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "Sad account of how toothless SEC enforcement against bank fraud really is: In SEC Fraud Cases, Banks Make and Break Promises Again and AgainConservatives complain about too much regulation; liberals say there isn't enough. I think the truth is that there's too much, done badly. A lot less, done well, might be the right answer.  I've been thinking a lot lately about how internet companies do what is the equivalent of regulation - Google and Bing have to fight web spam, ISPs have to filter email spam and viruses, Paypal and credit cards have to detect and deal with credit card fraud. This is a kind of \"algorithmic regulation,\" where there's a desired outcome and a variety of tools deployed to achieve it. They aren't always as effective as we wish they were, but you don't have this sense of utterly useless bureaucratic handslaps while the behavior continues.Here's the opening of the NYT article about toothless SEC regulation:\"When Citigroup agreed last month to pay $285 million to settle civil charges that it had defrauded customers during the housing bubble, the Securities and Exchange Commission wrested a typical pledge from the company: Citigroup would never violate one of the main antifraud provisions of the nation\u2019s securities laws.Senator Carl Levin, left, a Michigan Democrat, said the S.E.C.\u2019s method of settling fraud cases, is \u201ca symbol of weak enforcement.\" Robert Khuzami, the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement director, said never-do-it again promises were a deterrent, especially when there were repeated problems.To an outsider, the vow may seem unusual. Citigroup, after all, was merely promising not to do something that the law already forbids. But that is the way the commission usually does business. It also was not the first time the firm was making that promise.Citigroup\u2019s main brokerage subsidiary, its predecessors or its parent company agreed not to violate the very same antifraud statute in July 2010. And in May 2006. Also as far as back as March 2005 and April 2000.Citigroup has a lot of company in this regard on Wall Street. According to a New York Times analysis, nearly all of the biggest financial companies \u2014 Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America among them \u2014 have settled fraud cases by promising that they would never again violate an antifraud law, only to have the S.E.C. conclude they did it again a few years later.\"\ufeff",

It contains some ruminations about ebooks, what we were trying to get at when we started working on ebooks at O'Reilly almost 25 years ago, and what we're still trying to get at with our ebook publishing efforts.  You might want to read the whole blog post (linked below), but I thought I'd also offer a few teasers.\"Here's the key takeaway: our original ebook vision was of a world in which ebooks would be published in standard formats and could be read on any device, and where dominance of a particular piece of software or a particular e-reading device would not lock people in. We wanted reading to remain as open as it did when printed books ruled the publishing world.\"When the web took off, we thought that battle had largely been won. But the new world of dedicated e-reading devices with proprietary formats has brought back the specter of a single company having a monopoly on the tools for reading - and publishing - long form content.\"It's important for publishers to take a stand for reading portability and open access. Offer books in multiple open formats, DRM-free, and from multiple points of distribution, or the world of reading will eventually come to resemble the world of desktop software in the age of Microsoft's dominance.\"\ufeff",

I suggested to +Allen Noren, who runs oreilly.com, that we ought to do a series of x vs y promotions scored by whether product x or product y generates more sales.  And of course, because vi vs emacs was the provocation for the idea, we thought we'd start there. Accordingly, today's @oreillymedia\"deal of the day\" pits vi against emacs. http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/pq/271Of course, because a contest like this cuts out anyone who's already bought any of the relevant books, we wanted to give people a chance to vote for their favorite. As of right now, vi/vim is in the lead by about 60% to 40% - but that's down from the old vi vs emacs paintball days, when the signups for the vi team were always 2x the emacs team.Let me know in the comments what other \"face-offs\" you might enjoy seeing, as well as ideas for creatively engaging people in exploring backlist titles that they might love if only they knew about them.  There are the obvious examples - language books, operating systems, devices - but I bet there are other creative ideas that we're missing.\ufeff",

It lets you answer a question at greater length than twitter, but has the informality that blogs have grown out of (except perhaps for lightweight blogs like tumblr and posterous).And of course there's also the tremendous engagement that I get on G+. Your mileage may vary, but only a few months in, I get as many comments on my G+ posts as I do on my blog, and the G+ engagement is growing, while the blog has long been flat.There are drawbacks, of course. It's hard to do justice to multiple links, for example.What I really wish is that G+ had many of the features of storify, that is a next generation approach to commenting on social media and blogs and news, rather than becoming more \"blog like.\" Just as you can now drag in one link, it would be great to be able to drag in or type in multiple ones, and get a thumbnail on the spot, which you can then write around.But it's got to be simple, or else this just becomes another blogging platform.\ufeff",

   "content": "I wrote a short piece for Forbes last week, which went out under the title Tim O'Reilly Picks the World's Most Powerful Data Scientists . It's one of those slide shows that abbreviates the short paragraph underneath each picture, so I figured I'd republish the full text here. But more than that, I wanted to add a bit of color on the rationale I used for the somewhat unconventional list I chose. I also plan to write a separate post that gives you the \"outtakes\" - the much longer list that I wrote up before settling on the seven (really ten, since I chose three pairs) that I handed in to Forbes.That final list is very different from the one I started with. The original list skewed much more towards \"in the trenches\" data science practitioners and inventors. I wasn't happy with it, mainly thinking about the Forbes business audience. Names like \"Doug Cutting, the creator of Hadoop\" might be too much inside baseball for people outside of tech. I then did a list that represented business leaders behind big data plays - everyone from Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos to Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies. But I wasn't happy with that list either, since it seemed too obvious. The final list was a combination of a few big names, a few practitioners, and a few people who are outside the \"envelope\" of the original assignment because they aren't strictly data scientists, but who tell an important story about industries that are being affected by big data. With that preamble, here's the final list I submitted to Forbes:Tim O'Reilly Picks the World's Most Powerful Data Scientists\"The success of companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix, not to mention Wall Street firms and industries from manufacturing and retail to healthcare, is increasingly driven by better tools for extracting meaning from very large quantities of data. \"Data Scientist\" is now the hottest job title in Silicon Valley.Larry PageGoogle has done more than any other company to push the boundaries of what is possible with big data. Along with Sergey Brin, Page built the search engine that tamed the web, solved the problem posed by John Wanamaker a century ago (\"Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half.\"), and has proceeded to accumulate the largest database on the planet in his quest to provide access to all the world's information. Anyone who recognizes the data science behind Google's self-driving car can understand the scope of Page's vision.Jeff Hammerbacher and DJ PatilHammerbacher and Patil coined the term \"data scientist\", now Silicon Valley's hottest job title, and built the first formal data science teams, at Facebook and LinkedIn respectively. Now at Cloudera, Hammerbacher has been key to driving the success of Hadoop as a standard tool for processing large, unstructured data sets with a network of commodity computers. As Data Scientist in Residence at Greylock Ventures, Patil is seeking out the next generation of hot data-driven startups.Sebastian Thrun and Peter NorvigWhen Thrun and Norvig decided to teach their Stanford course, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, over the internet, they quickly signed up over 140,000 students [actually 160,000 - the number was still going up as I went to press], proving that this is no longer just an academic subject. Norvig is Google's chief scientist; Stanford professor Thrun is the leader of Google's effort to build a self-driving car that relies not just on AI algorithms, but the memory of hundreds of thousands of miles driven by Google's street view vehicles, recording and measuring everything they saw. Elizabeth WarrenThe banking system excesses that led to the economic crash of 2008 are an example of big data gone wrong. As the provisional head of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, Elizabeth Warren began the job of building the algorithmic checks and balances needed to counter the sorcerer's apprentices of Wall Street. In her campaign for the US Senate, she promises to continue that fight.Todd ParkThe Chief Technology Officer of the Department of Health and Human Services is leading the charge to transform American healthcare into a data driven business. From medical diagnostics to insurance reimbursement to community health statistics, Park is finding ways to use data to make healthcare more effective and affordable.Sandy PentlandSandy is not only a wide-ranging polymath, he's providing the intellectual leadership on how sensors, the internet of things, geolocation and promiscuous connectivity can be used to uncover insights regarding human behavior. Sandy is also looking at privacy - an important adjunct to the data space - and helping develop the conversation regarding the trade-offs between privacy and the value of personal data.Hod Lipson and Michael SchmidtWhen Cornell computer scientists Hod Lipson and Michael Schmidt created an AI program that could distill the laws of motion merely by observing data about the swinging of a pendulum, they kicked off the field of robotic science, in which AIs try to derive meaning from datasets too large or complex for humans to study.\"Why I chose the people I didLarry was obvious. He stood in for all the Silicon Valley companies that are built on big data, as one of the founders, and now the CEO of what is arguably the most important of those companies. I chose Jeff and DJ rather than Mark Zuckerberg to stand in for the importance of social networking both to give a nod to the practitioners at the heart of these great companies, but also because they coined the term \"data scientist.\"Sebastian and Peter were also a shoe-in. In addition to the things I wrote about in Forbes, Norvig is the author of the leading AI textbook, and Thrun a key player in the development of the Google autonomous vehicle. They are out on the front lines in a variety of ways, but the astonishing success of their course stands in for the way that data science is becoming mainstream.From there, things were driven a bit by advocacy. I knew the financial industry had to be in the story. I toyed with including Nobel prize winner Harry Markowitz, the father of modern quantitative portfolio theory (and thus arguably the guy who started Wall Street down the path that led to all the trouble) or Jim Simons, of whom my friend Peter Bloom says \"no one in history has made as much money based on math as he has.\" But I finally settled on Elizabeth Warren because I wanted to emphasize the need to rein in the speculation on Wall Street rather than to celebrate it. And I wanted to highlight that when she was working on the Consumer Finance Protection Board, she was thinking hard about what role technology could play in building a truly 21st century regulatory agency, and in my books, that will have to mean what I've been calling \"algorithmic regulation.\"To highlight the Obama administration's attempts to make health care more accountable and numbers driven, I could have chosen Federal CTO Aneesh Chopra, Don Berwick of the Center for Medicare Services, or Farzad Moshtahari, the National Coordinator for Healthcare. I chose Todd for his entrepreneurial background, his tireless enthusiasm, and his inspirational role in making public health something that is measurable.I wanted someone to highlight the role that sensors are increasingly playing in generating data throughout our society. I decided to highlight Sebastian Thrun's AI course rather than his self-driving car, so he was already covered. I might have chosen Pascale Witz, who heads up GE's diagnostics business, or Deborah Estrin, who has been a pioneer in distributed sensing and is now working on a platform for sensors in mobile health. But I ended up settling on Sandy Pentland because he also brought in an opportunity to highlight the issues of privacy that are so important in the big data world.Finally, I threw in Hod Lipson and Michael Schmidt, despite the fact that their work has not yet had wide impact outside fairly narrow scientific circles, precisely because of the opportunity to get the Forbes readership thinking about truly disruptive innovation. It's easy for articles like this to focus on what's hot now. But for me, the right thing to focus on is what's happening now that will become hot over time. If, as William Gibson says, \"the future is here, it's just not evenly distributed yet,\" telling people about things that are already well distributed misses the point. Part of what I try to do in my work is to help people see what's already happening that will have an outsized impact in years to come.This was a tough assignment. I enjoyed doing it, though even with all the explanations above, I'm not truly satisfied with my final list. There is so much fascinating work going on in this field, so many people to recognize, and I just can't do justice to them all.P.S. Last night I was chatting with +DJ Patil, and he suggested someone I hadn't thought of, who might well have made the final cut if he'd occurred to me: Jim Hansen, the NASA climate scientist who has been at the forefront of the global warming debate. Climate change is a big data problem par-excellence, modeling systems that are chaotic and unbelievably complex, and where the stakes may be higher than anything else we face. And it's an area where, if anywhere, data science rather than politics ought to be driving our decisions.\ufeff",

The book won't be final till January, but it's part of an early release program, where you get the author's first draft as well as subsequent drafts, up to the final ebook. I love how computer vision ties together the worlds of machine learning and making (something I first realized when we published +Toby Segaran's Programming Collective Intelligence  and +Gary Bradski and +Adrian Kaehler's Learning OpenCV http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596516130.do, and in reviewing the two books, I saw just how many algorithms they had in common!  Collective intelligence and robotics has been on my mind since, as anyone who's seen my recent talks meditating on the significance of the Google autonomous vehicle project will realize.)While I'm at it, I have to celebrate the vision and persistence of +Dale Dougherty, who first realized and named the \"Maker Movement\" (and created Make: magazine and Maker Faire to celebrate it.)  This book is part of the Make: branded publishing program. As it turns out, Dale is being celebrated today at the White House as a Champion of Change for his work in advancing STEM education through the Maker movement.\ufeff",

   "content": "It's interesting to see how short memory is. I was looking at this article today about Vim's 20th birthday http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2011/11/two-decades-of-productivity-vims-20th-anniversary.ars, and thought, \"It isn't really Vim's 20th birthday. It's a lot closer to its 35th!\"  Because of course, vim is really just an extended and improved version of the venerable vi, the first screen-oriented editor for Unix.While the article starts out with a history of vi, it somehow treats it as if it were a grandparent, rather than the template for what remains.  The core design of vim reflects the design insights of Bill Joy, not those of Bram Moolenaar, who refined and updated them.I find the same kind of historical revisionism about Linux and Unix. For all practical purposes, Linux IS Unix, the system designed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, the system whose \"architecture of participation\" led to the first collaboratively developed operating system, of which Linux is an implementation.  Linus Torvalds did a magnificent job of bringing Unix to its current level of success, but let's not forget the people who originally designed it.It's important to distinguish between software that is a descendant of another piece of software, as say, Unix was a descendant of Multics, or Java of C, and software that is literally a version (albeit an improved version) of what went before.I remember working with +Linda Lamb on the first edition of our book Learning the Vi Editor (now Learning the Vi and Vim Editors http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529833.do ) back in 1986, when Vi was already a decade old.  The intro I wrote for the original edition still survives, though it's been rewritten half a dozen times.The original version of that introduction more clearly reflected my joy in discovering vi, it's seemingly arcane interface that actually turned out to be a marvel of design, so perfectly adapted to the needs of text editing that I have yet to find a better tool for the job.  I celebrate Bram Moolenaar's update to Vi, but I celebrate even more deeply Bill Joy's original creation.\ufeff",

The bill was repealed by a Republican Congress, on strict party lines in the Senate (albeit with bipartisan support in the House, reminding us why the Founders had a Senate in the first place).This morning, when I tweeted a link to an NPR story:What 8 years of Republican leadership brought-at end of Clinton admin, economists worried about end of US National Debt http://slashdot.org/story/11/10/29/001214/when-having-the-us-debt-paid-off-was-a-problemI got the inevitable response from someone using the handle puppetMaster3:@timoreilly It was clinton that canceled glass steagall actJust because something happened during the Clinton administration doesn't make him responsible. It's Congress that passes the laws, and in this case, it was a Republican bill passed by a Republican-controlled congress. So please stop trying to pass the blame.There are initiatives that presidents lead (like Bush's choice to go to war in Iraq rather than pursuing Bin Laden in Afghanistan). And there are things that were done in accord with Democratic policies (like pushing for more home ownership by low-income folks), but please, let's not pretend that repealing Glass-Steagall was Clinton's fault.From the Wikipedia article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_Act (which has a pretty good summary of the whole thing):\"The bill that ultimately repealed the Act was brought up in the Senate by Phil Gramm (R-Texas) and in the House of Representatives by Jim Leach (R-Iowa) in 1999. The bills were passed by a Republican majority, basically following party lines by a 54\u201344 vote in the Senate[9] and by a bi-partisan 343\u201386 vote in the House of Representatives.[10] After passing both the Senate and House the bill was moved to a conference committee to work out the differences between the Senate and House versions. The final bill resolving the differences was passed in the Senate 90\u20138 (one not voting) and in the House: 362\u201357 (15 not voting). The legislation was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on November 12, 1999.[11] Proponents argue that repealing the provisions had little impact on the financial system and even helped restore stability during the financial crisis.[12][13] Ten years after its repeal, detractors condemn Glass-Stegall's repeal for reestablishing conflict of interest within the financial industry and fostering \"too big to fail\" institutions that led to the housing market collapse and its associated financial crisis.

But what really distinguishes it is its nuanced, intelligent descriptions of just how these projects work, noticing what is important about them in a way that few popular summaries do.For example, consider this insightful line about the community behind Wikipedia:\"Wikipedia is not an encyclopedia. It is a virtual city, a city whose main export to the world its its encyclopedia articles, but with an internal life of its own.\"The book is full of gems like that, lessons from internet experiments in collective intelligence, with deep thought about how they apply to the future of what Nielsen calls Networked Science.Highly recommended!\ufeff",

   "content": "Steve Jobs on his major mistake during Apple's troubled years: \"Letting profitability outweigh passion\" http://huff.to/nNHjGY #ditto (a tweet by @stevecase) struck home for me, because in the aftermath of Jobs' death I've been thinking a lot about O'Reilly, wanting to make sure that we streamline and focus on the stuff that matters most.Here's the money quote from the article:\"My passion has been to build an enduring company where people were motivated to make great products,\" Jobs told Isaacson. \"[T]he products, not the profits, were the motivation. Sculley flipped these priorities to where the goal was to make money. It's a subtle difference, but it ends up meaning everything.\"Jobs went on to describe the legacy he hoped he would leave behind, \"a company that will still stand for something a generation or two from now.\"\"That's what Walt Disney did,\" said Jobs, \"and Hewlett and Packard, and the people who built Intel. They created a company to last, not just to make money. That's what I want Apple to be.\"All of our greatest work at O'Reilly has been driven by passion and idealism. That includes our early forays into publishing, when we were a documentation consulting company to pay the bills but wrote documentation on the side for programs we used that didn't have any good manuals.  It was those manuals, on topics that no existing tech publisher thought were important, that turned us into a tech publisher \"who came out of nowhere.\"In the early days of the web, we were so excited about it that +Dale Dougherty wanted to create an online magazine to celebrate the people behind it. That morphed into GNN, the Global Network Navigator, the web's first portal and first commercial ad-supported site.In the mid-90s, realizing that no one was talking about the programs that were behind all our most successful books, I brought together a collection of free software leaders (many of whom had never met each other) to brainstorm a common story. That story redefined free software as open source, and the world hasn't been the same since.  It also led to a new business for O'Reilly, as we launched our conference business to help bring visibility to these projects, which had no company marketing behind them.Thinking deeply about open source and the internet got me thinking big ideas about the internet as operating system, and the shift of influence from software to network effects in data as the key to future applications. I was following people who at the time seemed \"crazy\" - but they were just living in a future that hadn't arrived for the rest of the world yet.  It was around this time that I formulated our company mission of \"changing the world by spreading the knowledge of innovators.\"In 2003, in the dark days after the dot com bust, our company goal for the year was to reignite enthusiasm in the computer business. Two outcomes of that effort did just that: +Sara Winge 's creation of Foo Camp spawned a worldwide, grassroots movement of self-organizing \"unconferences,\" and our Web 2.0 Conference told a big story about where the net was going and what distinguished the companies that survived the dotcom bust from those that preceded it.  In 2005, seeing the passion that was driving garage inventors to a new kind of hardware innovation, Dale once again wanted to launch a magazine to celebrate the passionate people behind the movement.  This time, it was a magazine: Make: (http://makezine.com), and a year later, we launched Maker Faire (http://makerfaire.com) as a companion event. 150,000 people attended Maker Faires last year, and the next generation of startups is emerging from the ferment of the movement that Dale named.Meanwhile, through those dark years after the dotcom bust, we also did a lot of publishing just to keep the company afloat.  (With a small data science team at O'Reilly, we built a set of analytical tools that helped us understand the untapped opportunities in computer book publishing. We realized that we were playing in only about 2/5 of the market; moving into other areas that we had never been drawn to helped pay the bills, but never sparked the kind of creativity as the areas that we'd found by following our passion.)It was at this time that I formulated an image that I've used many times since: profit in a business is like gas in a car. You don't want to run out of gas, but neither do you want to think that your road trip is a tour of gas stations.When I think about the great persistence of Steve Jobs, there's a lesson for all of us in it.What's so great about the Apple story is that Steve ended up making enormous amounts of money without making it a primary goal of the company.  (Ditto Larry and Sergey at Google.)  Contrast that with the folks who brought us the 2008 financial crisis, who were focused only on making money for themselves, while taking advantage of others in the process.Making money through true value creation driven by the desire to make great things that last, and make the world a better place - that's the heart of what is best in capitalism.  (See also the wonderful HBR blog post, Steve Jobs and the Purpose of the Corporation. http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/10/steve_jobs_and_the_purpose_of.html  I also got a lot of perspective on this topic from +Leander Kahney's book, Inside Steve's Brain http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Steves-Brain-Leander-Kahney/dp/1591841984 )\ufeff",

   "content": "This is really important stuff. Whether ebay succeeds or not in its plan to become \"the operating system for commerce\" - a technology-based e-commerce platform that blurs the boundary between online and offline. \"The wall between online ecommerce and retail is crumbling faster than anyone expected,\" he says, and notes that the consumer accesses the web somewhere during the purchase cycle in half of all retail transactions today, often while they are in the store.By putting together ebay, paypal, and recent acquisitions like GSI, into the x.commerce platform, ebay wants to enable merchants.

   "content": "UPDATE: I am really embarrassed. I should have read the bill. It does not mandate vaccination; it merely allows it without parental consent, at the request of a minor.Whatever the merits of the vaccine, there is no problem allowing people to make this choice. If young people are making the choice to have sex without their parents' consent (and yes, they are), they should also be able to make the choice to protect themselves.Here is the text of the bill: http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/asm/ab_0451-0500/ab_499_bill_20110902_enrolled.htmlI should have known that anything being pushed so hard by the religious right was likely being pushed on the basis of misinformation. I just looked in the wrong place.My original post is below. Apologies for not doing my homework correctly.(And yes, due to comments on the all caps, I switched to bold for and update to this update!)I don't usually have sympathy for anti-vaccine activists, but in this case, I suspect they are right.I remember the incidence of serious infectious disease in America when I was a kid, and how less frequent it is today, thanks to vaccination. I understand, as so many anti-vaccine activists don't seem to, the concept of herd immunity. I react badly to so many of the rants about the risks of this or that (including vaccines), with complete innumerate disregard to the benefits, or the comparative risk of other things that are taken for granted.And yet, in this particular case, there seems to be some fire beneath all the smoke. The vaccine doesn't seem to work all that well; it has significant side-effects; it will increase costs in the medical system (because it doesn't work well, all of the same screening will still be required). I looked at some independent sites to confirm some of the controversy raised by the advocacy site linked to below as the main \"share\" and they did in fact confirm the level of controversy.http://www-scf.usc.edu/~uscience/gardasil_vaccine.htmlIn short, if there were ever a bad test case for a law that actually mandates a vaccination without parental knowledge or consent, this is the one. I can see the case for mandating a proven vaccine for a serious killer where incidence is on the rise because of parental opt-out. But this is surely not the vaccine to start with.Finally, given the political tensions in this country, anyone in government ought to be painfully aware of the risks of government overreaching its authority. The legitimate debate about the role of government is so easily buried by controversy. A bill like this just pours fuel on the wrong fire.I agree that Jerry Brown ought to veto this bill.P.S. I'd appreciate any insights from people who are closer to the science than I am.\ufeff",

I don't know if they hold up without a lot more digging, and I've seen far more pessimistic perspectives on the land use impact of solar, notably from my son-in-law +saul griffith. (See http://peakenergy.blogspot.com/2009/01/saul-griffith-renewistan-and-energy.html ) And there are a lot of other numbers in here that most likely need a lot of scrubbing.But that isn't where I want to take this discussion. Where I want to take it is the fundamental assumptions that have been used to shoot down renewable energy:  \"It isn't economically competitive.\"  But how do we measure \"economically competitive? In corporate profits, of course.  And those corporate profits, like so much else in our economy, are inflated by all kinds of Ponzi externalities, from negative environmental impacts and inflated health care costs to the destruction of jobs - off-balance sheet debits that will one day catch up with our entire society.What if instead of corporate profits, we measured \"economically competitive\" in terms of the overall health and happiness of our society, instead of in the profits of the paper economy?  There are rumblings of new thinking in this direction.  There's no question that there are difficulties in the transition, and that there is much to learn from the efficiencies of the market economy we've built based on keeping score of corporate profits, but there's also no question that there is more than one way to run a society, and we can be almost certain that we don't live in \"the best of all possible worlds.\"Part of what fascinates me about #OccupyWallStreet (or #OWS, as the hashtag has now been shortened) is its inchoate appeal for our economy and our society to play by new rules, and to stop rewarding so highly behavior that is so clearly not in the best interests of our society. I don't think the #OWS protesters know what they want to replace Wall Street lootonomics with, but they are right to call attention to the fact that there is something badly wrong.On a somewhat related note, Neil Stephenson wrote about our lack of big dreams in a piece called Innovation Starvation. http://johniac.posterous.com/innovation-starvation-world-policy-institute Part of what's gone wrong with our dreams is that we are counting the score in the wrong game.\ufeff",

   "content": "Fantastic piece on \"Innovation Starvation\" by +Neal Stephenson. \"I worry that our inability to match the achievements of the 1960s space program might be symptomatic of a general failure of our society to get big things done. My parents and grandparents witnessed the creation of the airplane, the automobile, nuclear energy, and the computer to name only a few. Scientists and engineers who came of age during the first half of the 20th century could look forward to building things that would solve age-old problems, transform the landscape, build the economy, and provide jobs for the burgeoning middle class that was the basis for our stable democracy.The Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010 crystallized my feeling that we have lost our ability to get important things done. The OPEC oil shock was in 1973\u2014almost 40 years ago. It was obvious then that it was crazy for the United States to let itself be held economic hostage to the kinds of countries where oil was being produced. It led to Jimmy Carter\u2019s proposal for the development of an enormous synthetic fuels industry on American soil. Whatever one might think of the merits of the Carter presidency or of this particular proposal, it was, at least, a serious effort to come to grips with the problem.Little has been heard in that vein since. We\u2019ve been talking about wind farms, tidal power, and solar power for decades. Some progress has been made in those areas, but energy is still all about oil. In my city, Seattle, a 35-year-old plan to run a light rail line across Lake Washington is now being blocked by a citizen initiative. Thwarted or endlessly delayed in its efforts to build things, the city plods ahead with a project to paint bicycle lanes on the pavement of thoroughfares.In early 2011, I participated in a conference called Future Tense, where I lamented the decline of the manned space program, then pivoted to energy, indicating that the real issue isn\u2019t about rockets. It\u2019s our far broader inability as a society to execute on the big stuff.\"A similar idea is explored by Peter Thiel's recent piece The End of the Future (http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/print/278758 ) but I consider Stephenson's take to be even more provocative.\ufeff",

   "content": "I went back down to Zuccotti Park in Manhattan to see how the #OccupyWallStreet protest was progressing a few weeks after my last visit (which I wrote about in https://plus.google.com/107033731246200681024/posts/Sy8Z2uWy655?hl=en).  The crowd was larger - perhaps twice the size - and signs of permanent organization are starting to appear.  The mood was serious but many of those in attendance really seemed to be enjoying themselves, and there was a real sense of community.I was hoping to get on camera to voice my support for some of the key ideas behind this protest - that many of the companies in our financial sector have started extracting far more value from our society than they provide to it, and that we need businesses to remember a more honest form of capitalism, where companies make money by providing sufficient value to customers that they are happy to pay for it, where the gap between the amount extracted in profits to owners doesn't so far outstrip the amount paid to workers in the business that those workers need to go into debt to pay for ordinary living expenses, where government protects all its citizens, not just those who can afford lobbyists, and where society as a whole feels the virtuous circle that can only happen when companies create more value than they capture for themselves.Alas, there was a press conference going on, with all cameras focused on an existing lineup of speakers. Since I only had a half-hour before heading for JFK for my flight home to SFO, I wasn't able to get on camera.One of my favorite things about the protest (besides the issue they are bringing to the fore) is the lovely crowdsourced megaphone, in which the speaker's words are echoed phrase by phrase in shouts by the crowd of those closest to the front so that those further back can hear.  There's a great example of this human megaphone in the video of +Dylan Ratigan's visit, which I happened to see on my Virgin flight in to New York yesterday.  I've embedded a link below.I'm not fond of all the populist rhetoric by some of the protestors.  It's understandable though, why people are using the language of class warfare when the other side is actually practicing it. But name calling both obscures the fundamental rightness of the #OccupyWallStreet position and alienates those who might otherwise be supporters (after all, even Warren Buffett, one of the greatest capitalists of the past half-century, agrees with many of their positions).  And as the Tea Party has also shown, anger gets attention.  But anger can get out of control, which is why it's so important for the #OccupyWallStreet movement to do some work on message control.  I'd suggest that the protesters get a bunch of copies of Gene Sharp's From Dictatorship to Democracy http://aeinstein.org/organizations98ce.html, which was reportedly influential in the Arab Spring, and study it. There's something building here that I really like.  But it's important that it go right.  (Hmm.  I think I'll order a bunch of copies and send them there.)As I think about all of these revolutions around the world, I'm constantly mindful of a book I read a few years ago, Jay Winik's The Great Upheaval, which contrasts the American Revolution, the French Revolution, and an abortive revolution in Russia that was put down by Catherine the Great at about the same time. We're not talking a revolution here in America, but there are lots of lessons to be learned from past and present revolutions.  And in their heedlessness and their greed, the Wall Street bankers do so remind me of French aristocrats before that Revolution, which began so nobly and ended so badly.\ufeff",

There are some sordid details on how it all works, followed by this conclusion:\"So while Wall Street is swearing up and down it was dealing only with sophisticated investors, in reality every single part of the financial system, from high to low, was involved. Taxpayers and investors lost money in the bailouts while the banks made a killing: They were paid by clients to do sloppy deals, then paid again by the government to clean them up.It's a top-to-bottom mess. So here's a radical idea: Instead of buying the notion that there's a difference line between sophisticated investors and the mom-and-pop variety, banks should tell the truth. To everyone. Wall Street is the factory for all the financial products in the United States, and you can't allow a factory to put out some poisonous products and claim the rest are healthy.\"\ufeff",

For example, in the past we took analog photos and could count them in the hundreds, maybe. Now we take digital photos, thousands of them, and post them online to share instantly with others. With the analog photos we might have just kept them in a shoebox or a photo album, which is how they would be passed on to our family. What\u2019s the equivalent of that for digital photos? Similarly, in the past we might have written a diary, which again would be passed on to others. Now, we share our thoughts and actions online with friends, which is the closest digital equivalent to a diary and like a diary could form a valuable record of our lives once we pass away. In what form should we preserve these digital diary entries?With this project, then, we\u2019re interested in looking at the fundamental human values of legacy\u2014why it feels instinctual to want to preserve and treasure the things we\u2019ve been left by our grandparents, for example\u2014and thinking about how those values apply in our digital world.\ufeff",

In terminal, type:$ ioreg -w0 -l | grep -i capacityYou should get back stats like these (from my machine):    | |           \"MaxCapacity\" = 4464    | |           \"CurrentCapacity\" = 2850    | |           \"LegacyBatteryInfo\" = {\"Amperage\"=18446744073709548064,\"Flags\"=4,\"Capacity\"=4464,\"Current\"=2850,\"Voltage\"=7362,\"Cycle Count\"=20}    | |           \"DesignCapacity\" = 4680Matt wrote:\"So the number for DesignCapacity and MaxCapacity should be darn close since your machine is so new. If it's not, you may have a defective battery. Especially if the cycle count is under 100-200.So, battery trouble.. it could be a couple things. I recently thought my battery might be defective in this Macbook Air, but I found that because I hadn't been letting it discharge enough before plugging it in, the battery wasn't working properly.I followed the old trick of trying to train the battery:1) Run it on battery life until it actually dies (not just red battery meter or a warning about \"the battery's about to die)2) Charge it up to 100%3) Run it on battery life until it dies again, and then charge it back to full again.\"I'm going to try that trick. If it doesn't work, I guess I do have a defective battery.\ufeff",

   "content": "The entertainment at Google Zeitgeist dinner - YouTube sensations like OK Go (over 200 million views) and Karmin (170 million) - hints at the future of entertainment media. Whoever it was who said that the internet model turns traditional media on its head, from curate then publish to publish first, then curate, surely got it right.YouTube is an amazing demonstration of the power of this principle, a true open, bottom-up media marketplace that is the closest thing we've seen to the \"whuffie\" based economy of Cory Doctorow's first book, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom.But it's not just an opportunity for 20 minutes of fame. There's a new advertising business model here too. With hundreds of millions of views, these bands are now media companies. It seems to me that the potential of YouTube to be a game changer in the media marketplace, a powerful new channel and business model for artists is still not widely understood. I bet there are as many people making a living on YouTube as in the iTunes app store, yet there's far less buzz about it.\ufeff",

Having consumed the ecosystem of independent booksellers, Amazon is now going after used booksellers.Selling used books online via Amazon has been one of the major revenue streams keeping used booksellers alive. It's perhaps inevitable but still sad to see Amazon going after one more piece of the pie.I do think that the best business ecosystems are complex, with money on the table for lots of players. One of the problems with what Amazon is doing is the risk that eventually the ecosystem becomes impoverished. That's why I try to keep reminding companies to \"create more value than you capture.\" - keeping a vibrant ecosystem is in your interest, and one way to measure that is to always ask who else is making money, and make sure that there is enough left on the table for others besides yourself.Overall, this is likely a good thing for consumers, I think. But it will probably continue to impoverish the ecosystem, hurting both publishers and the remaining booksellers.via +Tim Brandhorst\ufeff",

   "content": "This article about gamers solving a thorny protein folding problem important in AIDS research is being touted as a triumph of \"gamification,\" the application of game mechanics to other problem domains.  But there's an important lesson here.  Much of what is written about gamification (including some books published by my own company) focuses mainly on what I might call \"the shallow end of gamification,\" namely extrinsic motivators like points, leaderboards, and scoring.  But game experts concur that the heart of most games is the intrinsic motivation of challenge and learning.  And it is precisely that deep end of gamification that was on display here. Yes, \"winning\" matters, but it's winning at hard things - intrinsic motivation - that really matters. People aren't stupid.  Pasting scoring on trivial activities doesn't make them less trivial.  As Rilke said in his poem The Man Watching, \"What we fight with is so small, and when we win, it makes us small.\"  We want to be challenged by vast, hard things.The appeal of Foldit is that the problems it presents in spatial reasoning are challenging puzzles that force people to exercise their abilities. The fact that those abilities are put to work in a meaningful cause makes it even sweeter.Any company thinking about gamification should think hard. Jumping in the shallow end of the pool is a great way to break your neck. The right place to jump is in the deep end.\ufeff",

   "content": "Thoughts on Solyndra, and the government as VC.Note: I wrote this post back on September 8.  I thought it was public, but just discovered that it wasn't. It seems you can't just re-share your own private post as a public post (odd, that), so I'm creating a new post with the same content.+Ben Holtsclaw alerted me to the Solyndra collapse and asked if I'd comment. Overall, I'd say that the lessons of this failure are probably different than libertarians and small government advocates might think. Yes, our government is a terrible VC, and this was a very bad investment, based on a quasi-religious faith in American technological innovation as the solution.But the reasons for Solyndra's failure are classic business reasons: competition. But the competition in this case wasn't from \"the market\" in some generalized free-market sense, but from a concerted strategic market intervention by another government, namely the government of China.I heard recently from +jack hidary how the Chinese have driven solar panel prices down via vertical integration of the manufacturing process. No technological breakthroughs, just better market coordination through top-down planning.In short, the Chinese are just smarter than we are about government intervention. For what it's worth, it happens to private investors and private companies all the time too. Competition between governments and their strategies is just as real as competition between companies.I do agree very much that the Solendra investment was crazy - way too big given the competitive context. But the heartening news is that prices for solar panels are coming down.Here are some US government strategic interventions in the market that paid off big-time: the US interstate highway system in the 1950s, the research funding that led to the internet, the spinoffs from the space program (including satellite launch capabilities, weather forecasting improvements, crop monitoring from space, not to mention the usual suspects cited like Teflon pans), the GPS satellite system that has fueled tens of billions of dollars in private enterprise, making possible all the \"local\" frenzy that is driving additional investment. Ideal targets for government intervention are \"platforms\" or platform technologies that enable the market as a whole, rather than bets on individual companies.In short, the US government is like a VC firm, once first-tier, but one that has now lost its way. Getting out of the VC business is one option. Getting better at it is another. Given that the Chinese government is pretty good at making strategic investments, it seems to me that we need to at least consider what \"getting better\" at government investment means, rather than just getting out of the business.\ufeff",

   "content": "I just went down to check out the scene at the https://occupywallst.org/ rally. It was a bit of a disappointment, for a number of reasons. First, there were only a few hundred people there (one of the organizers told me they peaked out at around a thousand on the weekend). Second, the people who were there were the wrong people.What do I mean by that? The attendees were mainly scruffily dressed young people, whose attire and approach was too easily dismissed by those in authority. The smirk on the face of the Fox News reporter who was interviewing various participants said it all. \"These people are easy to dismiss.\"I couldn't bear to see him goading these idealistic young people into making bombastic statements (the reporter is a tool of AIG was one comment I overheard), so I stepped over and asked if I could speak to him.I told him that I run a company with about $100 million in revenue, and that it isn't just kids who think that Wall Street bankers got away with a crime. There are a set of people who constructed a set of financial products with intent to defraud. They took our country to the brink of ruin, then got off scott free, even with multi-million dollar bonuses. I'll be interested to see if Fox runs my comments anywhere.It seems so odd to me that the Tea Party isn't out in force at this protest. It seems so odd that government largesse aimed at rich corporations seems to be OK with them, while government largesse aimed at the disadvantaged ought to be cut. I would have loved to see blue collar Americans out in force at this protest, not just college students.(Personally, I'm all for a leaner approach to government that I've described with the geeky vision of \"Government as a Platform.\" Spend strategically in order to catalyze society to do what needs to be done. Unfortunately, in this case that wasn't done.)I highly recommend Matt Taibbi's Rolling Stone reporting on the financial crisis of 2008 http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-great-american-bubble-machine-20100405 , as well as these recent pieces: http://www.financialsense.com/financial-sense-newshour/guest-expert/2011/09/14/william-k-black-phd/why-nobody-went-to-jail-during-the-credit-crisis and http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/09/obamas_economic_quagmire_frank.html They should make your blood boil.It's not the American Spring yet, but it ought to be.Here are some of my photos from the event:\ufeff",

   "content": "18 months after President Obama authorized a program providing $7.6 billion to states to help homeowners escape foreclosure, fund have been awarded to only about 7500 homeowners. In the same time period, banks have foreclosed on 1.5 million homes.Stories like this one fuel disgust with government. What they really highlight is that we're trying to manage 21st century problems with 19th century methods.Rather than building a government bureaucracy to award funds, the program should have set goals for number of homeowners whose mortgages would be relieved (or even better, the conditions that would justify loan modification) and left it to the banks to meet those expectations.The regulatory overhead should have been in testing outcomes, not managing process.Let me be clear by analogy.  Imagine that Google's search quality team wrote a set of rules for sites to be approved for inclusion in Google, and had a bureaucracy to allow sites into search results.  Instead, Google tests the quality of search results, and uses algorithmic regulation to remove results that are deemed bogus.  The analogy in this case isn't exact, but the idea of algorithmic regulation is central to all internet platforms, and provides a fruitful area for investigation in the design of 21st century government.\ufeff",

   "content": "A number of people have responded to my comment last night on Twitter:\"Hit my free 20 article limit for the month for @nytimes. Guess I won't be tweeting out any more of their links for a while...\"Many people sent me tips for getting around the limit. Others, though, were surprised to see my comment. For example,@notjim wrote:\"surely you see some irony in your statement, given the benefits you've reaped from a successful publishing business.\"@endashcunning wrote:\"you could pay? I could lend you some $ if you're tight\"and @timburks wrote\"now that you mention it, that paywall on safari books online really gets in the way sometimes\"First off, let me say that I'm not interested in getting around the limit - I respect the New York Times' right to set whatever policies they want for access to their content, and I will abide by them.  I know they need revenue to survive, and I want them to get it. And I know they are making tradeoffs between advertising revenue and subscription revenue, and are trying to find the right balance of the two.In that regard, I thought it was worth giving them a data point on one side of the ledger - that their limit was cutting off a major source of social media flow - one they themselves have celebrated (see http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/11/29/new-york-times-event-shows-the-promise-of-big-data/ )I have actually been a loyal New York Times subscriber for more than 20 years; my subscription recently lapsed (for reasons that are too complex to explain).  I have yet to re-subscribe because of the appalling service I received on that front as well.  One day, my login just stopped working. I tried to look up my subscription, and they said they had no record of it.  That was that. No attempt to get me to resubscribe, no notification that my account (with its six or seven thousand followers on Times People) had been deleted. No response to my email query in response to the form on their site.My point, I guess, is that whatever business model you want to adopt, it's essential to get good at it.  If you're straddling two business models, it's even more important.In this case, the New York Times' execution on both fronts is weak. They lost track of a loyal subscriber, and they failed to  pay attention to who sends them traffic online.  Both opportunities for improvement.Now, I know these things are hard - and to the many folks who might have similar complaints about subscription management at Safari or at Make: Magazine (O'Reilly's two subscription products), I apologize.  And I hope that the teams there pay attention as well.  And to the many folks at O'Reilly (and any other company) who are trying to get better at tying social media to purchases or subscriptions, I offer the same object lesson. We are more than cookies.\ufeff",

   "content": "Wow. +Sebastian Deterding just delivered a devastating review of +Gabe Zichermann's new book from O'Reilly, Gamification by Design. The issues Sebastian raises are serious enough that I thought I'd try to get more input on the book from those with more expertise on the subject than I have.A quick personal response: I believe strongly that intrinsic motivation trumps extrinsic motivation every time, that the real beauty of games isn't to play them for points, but for the joy of them, and that marketers pasting on superficial game mechanics to encourage people to accept inferior products is a terrible idea. Like any other marketing technique, \"gamification\" done badly is a disaster.  Any attempt to manipulate people, to use game mechanics to do things that are against their own self-interest, is terrible marketing.  It won't work out well in the end, for anyone.That being said, I also have experienced the power of \"game mechanics\" to make applications more engaging - for instance, since FourSquare added leaderboards, I have found myself using it (and enjoying it) more. I also have new affordances that make it more likely that I will check in and see what my friends are doing. So there's definitely \"some there there.\"In the end, I'm a bit puzzled by the amount of vitriol aimed at Gabe's book. I haven't read it cover to cover, but what I have read doesn't seem to justify the scorn heaped on it by this review. I do wonder sometimes if those whose work is popularized (and bastardized) by others take it too personally. I think of my own experience trying to make the case for \"Web 2.0\" - I was thinking of what distinguished the failures of the dot com bust from the companies that survived (Web \"1.0\" vs \"2.0\") -- deep trends in applications like \"harnessing collective intelligence\" and \"data as the intel inside of the next generation of applications\" - trends that have been well validated by ensuing events.And yes, I was disappointed to have the term I intended for one meaning be hijacked by marketers to mean something far more shallow, far less interesting. But in the end, I came to accept that it was all part of the hype cycle, and that as Tevye said in Fiddler on the Roof, \"Good news will stay, and bad news will refuse to leave.\" It's always a mixture of good and bad.I wonder if there's something like that going on here - folks who've been working to find deep insights about what we can learn from games to other applications feeling that their work is being hijacked in some way.But if the critiques of the book made here are accurate, I'd love to see our team work hard to make it better in future editions.\ufeff",

It's more complicated than that, but that's essentially the idea.\"+Roger Magoulas added: \"People as the last mile - a metaphor that I think makes sense for what ends up being the most successful machine learning and modeling efforts.\"I've been talking a lot lately about man-machine symbiosis as one of the frontiers of development. It cuts both ways: sometimes, humans are input to algorithms; sometimes, algorithms are input to humans. Pushing the boundaries of our cooperation, and realizing that it is a symbiosis, leads to interesting design decisions.That being said, in some cases, the \"human as the last mile\" is just a halfway house, as we've seen on Wall Street, where it's increasingly \"human as algorithm designer\" and \"human as circuit breaker\" but the algorithms are pretty much driving on their own most of the time.Would love examples of other technologies where people are pushing the boundary in one way or another.\ufeff",

   "content": "This @wsj article hints at some of the complex economics that keep ebook prices high. While it's true that ebooks don't have as much manufacturing cost associated with them, the manufacturing cost has always been a surprisingly small part of the overall cost of a book, except in the case of massively-hyped books that fail to live up to expectations. For example, for O'Reilly books in the heyday of print publishing, our manufacturing costs were always in the 15-16% of net sales range (i.e. roughly 8% of list price.)Now that print runs are getting smaller, manufacturing costs actually go up (because printing costs go down with volume).  So a book whose sales are 50% print and 50% ebook might actually have higher manufacturing costs than when the book was p-only.Meanwhile, the fixed costs of bringing a book to market are fairly high, at least for traditional publishers.  Those costs have to be spread across all revenue sources for the book - both p- and e-.As the attached WSJ article hints, there is downward pricing pressure from new low-cost self-publishers even though Amazon is no longer able to drive prices down by selling below cost.Meanwhile, in some cases lower prices drive much higher volumes, but this isn't always the case.  Net-net: expect publishers to experiment a lot with prices, to see what the tradeoffs are.  In the end, though, it's important to realize that most publishers aren't trying to gouge customers with a product that is somehow \"free\" to them.  They are trying to stay afloat by recouping the cost of developing their product plus a reasonable profit.\ufeff",

I love the idea that people out of work could try to start their own business rather than just looking for a job.This idea that you get a job from someone else rather than creating one through your own effort is fundamental to restarting the economy.  Even if you do end up working for someone else, the kind of mind that says \"It's my responsibility to make something useful with my time\" is one that is more likely to get brought into someone else's enterprise than one that is just passively looking for a pre-determined slot.It seems odd to me that unemployment insurance should have had this baked-in bias against self-employment, and it's fabulous that this inequality is being addressed.  What do you think?\ufeff",

   "content": "This New York Times piece on the Amazon-California sales tax dispute misses the long-term perspective. In the 90's, when online commerce was just taking off, having it free from sales tax was absolutely the right thing to do, since it gave an advantage to a fledgling industry that needed every advantage just to survive. But now that online commerce is becoming the dominant model in many industries, it is almost criminal to continue to provide that advantage.Like so many others, I love the convenience of shopping at Amazon, the unparalleled selection, the great customer service, the ease of checkout, the low prices. I don't need the added incentive of no sales tax to make me shop there. Yes, it would be a minor inconvenience for Amazon to collect sales tax for every county in the nation (but hardly the challenge they make it out to be, given the power of computers to handle repetitive tasks, and Amazon's vaunted capabilities at building scalable systems.) But at this point, the added advantage we're giving to them and other online retailers is completely unnecessary, except to gild their bottom line. Meanwhile, it's doing terrible damage at the local level, which our society will one day rue. We're seeing the result in shuttered local businesses, which degrades the quality of our towns. I was really surprised on a recent visit to Harvard Square to find the old Wordsworth bookstore location still empty seven years after the bookstore's closure. What a sign of the decline of local retail when a prime location in the heart of one of the most prestigious college towns in America has remained empty. I understand why it would not have been filled by another bookstore, but the fact that no other retailer has been able to survive there is a telling example of just how far the pendulum has swung in terms of what kind of business needs preferential tax treatment!The damage to local and state government is even greater. Local services depend on sales tax for their funding. As local retail declines, so does the community's tax base. Services decline (I was just in a vacation community in the Sierras this weekend where I was told I had to haul out my trash to another town 15 miles away!), and the quality of life goes with them.Amazon's attempt to avoid sales tax is one more sad example of the short-term thinking that rules American business. Amazon has to be aware of the long term trends in retail and its consequences for local communities, but they are selfishly putting their own short-term advantage over paying their own fair share of what it takes for us to function as a collaborative society.If California fails in its attempt to collect online sales tax, there will be other taxes levied on us that are far more onerous (see for example California's attempt to collect \"use taxes\" for online transactions http://consumerist.com/2011/03/california-may-go-after-online-shoppers-for-unpaid-taxes.html ) This shifts the compliance burden from an online retailer, who can easily track and charge the tax at point of sale, to us as individuals. This is a truly horrible outcome, one that would do far more to drive me away from online retail than paying sales tax. In an imaginary world where Jeff Bezos was as public spirited as he is far-sighted about pursuing competitive advantage, Amazon would not only willingly collect and pay sales tax, but would offer the infrastructure they built for doing so to other online businesses. Amazon would encourage other online retailers to also adopt this policy, realizing that a society in which every member pays a fair share is a far better society than one in which particular business segments or particular individuals successfully avoid paying taxes while still reaping the benefits that then must be paid for by others.\ufeff",

   "content": "+Ben Holtsclaw alerted me to the Solyndra collapse and asked if I'd comment. Overall, I'd say that the lessons of this failure are probably different than libertarians and small government advocates might think. Yes, our government is a terrible VC, and this was a very bad investment, based on a quasi-religious faith in American technological innovation as the solution.But the reasons for Solyndra's failure are classic business reasons: competition. But the competition in this case wasn't from \"the market\" in some generalized free-market sense, but from a concerted strategic market intervention by another government, namely the government of China.I heard recently from +jack hidary how the Chinese have driven solar panel prices down via vertical integration of the manufacturing process. No technological breakthroughs, just better market coordination through top-down planning.In short, the Chinese are just smarter than we are about government intervention. For what it's worth, it happens to private investors and private companies all the time too. Competition between governments and their strategies is just as real as competition between companies.I do agree very much that the Solendra investment was crazy - way too big given the competitive context. But the heartening news is that prices for solar panels are coming down.Here are some US government strategic interventions in the market that paid off big-time: the US interstate highway system in the 1950s, the research funding that led to the internet, the spinoffs from the space program (including satellite launch capabilities, weather forecasting improvements, crop monitoring from space, not to mention the usual suspects cited like Teflon pans), the GPS satellite system that has fueled tens of billions of dollars in private enterprise, making possible all the \"local\" frenzy that is driving additional investment.  Ideal targets for government intervention are \"platforms\" or platform technologies that enable the market as a whole, rather than bets on individual companies.In short, the US government is like a VC firm, once first-tier, but one that has now lost its way. Getting out of the VC business is one option. Getting better at it is another. Given that the Chinese government is pretty good at making strategic investments, it seems to me that we need to at least consider what \"getting better\" at government investment means, rather than just getting out of the business.\ufeff",

Interestingly enough, I woke up this morning thinking that I ought to write a book on a related subject, a meditation on my mantram: Create More Value Than You Capture: an ecosystem approach to business.There's a drumbeat of thinking on this subject these days, a realization that much of modern business has lost its way, that it's been focused on creating what Umair Haque calls \"thin value\" (money extracted from customers without real value creation), and that we're reaching the end of an era.It's easy to dismiss this stuff as defeatist thinking about the decline of the US.  It's important instead to learn from it, and to start the painful process of change.\ufeff",

A lot of people look at an emerging trend, and do a linear extrapolation.  And certainly, there are interesting businesses along the direct trend line of the quantified self - fitbit, withings, Fitness Keeper (in which OATV is an investor), and even monitoring of clinical indicators like glucose levels.  But there are also lots and lots of investments along the broader front of which the obvious applications are simply harbingers.This story about the potential use of EEG-monitoring headrests in cars to detect drowsiness (and might we suspect drunkenness?) is one good example. It seems to me that there will be applications in security (biometrics), in control systems (think how Kinect has already been used for everything from a motion controller to a monitor for the progress of neurological disorders), and in passive affordances for the \"internet of things\" like the ones described in this article.

Whether you have grading done by an algorithm or by an outside service that doesn't know the student, why the heck not outsource it? But if the function of grading is to assist in the teaching process, outsourcing grading misses the point.One teacher I know, who has been teaching writing at a top prep school for over 40 years, told me recently that he's often up till 1 am grading papers. I sent him this article to get his reaction. He wrote:\"Responding to student papers is a teaching activity, not contest-judge work, and so fairness or unfairness isn't even an issue.\"He is up till all hours because marking papers is part of his teaching. He's not scoring a test or an essay for purposes of giving a grade. It strikes me that the whole idea of computerized or outsourced grading is based on a failure to understand what education is really about.A better direction might well be the one suggested by teachers who have adopted Khan Academy lectures, effectively outsourcing the lecturing so they can spend more time one-on-one with students.\ufeff",

   "content": "\"Really fascinating piece by +John Robb  (via +Glyn Moody (@glynmoody)) outlining the idea that concentration of wealth in the US has led to what is, in essence, a centrally planned economy, with all the ills that entails.  This is one of those eye-opening connect-the-dots pieces that everyone should read.Robb writes:\"Of course, the misallocation due to centralized decision making wasn't supposed to be a vulnerability of the West.  To allocate resources in our economy, we had a conceptually more efficient mechanism: markets.  Markets are supposed to be a mechanism that allows massively parallel decision making.\"Those assumptions are proving false. The succession of market bubbles, the global financial collpse of 2008, and the recent US debt problem is prima facie evidence that gross misallocation has occurred for decades.  The wealth of the West, particularly the US, is being spent on the wrong things year after year, decade after decade.   We are now as fragile as the Soviet Union in the late 80's.\"What happened?\"Central planning took over the decision making process in the US, both through the growth of government and through an unparalleled concentration of wealth...\"The parallels between the rapid growth of US government bureaucracy and the Soviet bureaucracy is straight forward.  As more and more of US economy was controlled by a narrow group of decision makers allocating government resources, the more sluggish the entire economy became (most of this was due to massive growth and mis-allocation in entitlements and defense).  Further, the ability of government bureaucracies to extend their decision making to remaining majority of the economy through regulatory action, is also a form of centralization.  However, even with all of this government growth, it's is still not enough to account for the level of misallocation we are seeing.  \"There's is something else at work.\"The answer is that an extreme concentration of wealth at the center of our market economy has led to a form of central planning.   The concentration of wealth is now in so few hands and is so extreme in degree, that the combined liquid financial power of all of those not in this small group is inconsequential to determining the direction of the economy.   As a result, we now have the equivalent of centralized planning in global marketplaces.  A few thousand extremely wealthy people making decisions on the allocation of our collective wealth.  The result was inevitable:  gross misallocation across all facets of the private economy.\"\ufeff",

This ethic that modulates, even if it does not fully eliminate, the concentration of power. Anonymous provides what Mike Wesch had described as \u201ca scathing critique of the postmodern cult of celebrity, individualism, and identity while serving itself as the inverted alternative.\u201d 6 It is key to note that participants do not only wax philosophical about this commitment; they enact it. Participants remind each other with remarkable frequency that one should not behave like a leader, nor seek personal attention in the media, calling the practice \u201cname fagging\u201d or \u201cleaderfagging.\u201d\u201d7  If you do 'leaderfag', you most certainly will receive a private or public drubbing, and if you have called a lot of attention to yourself, then with a mere keystroke, you might be instantly banished from IRC.\"\ufeff",

I think it was about 2003 that I first wrote \"Data is the next Intel Inside\"; When I wrote What is Web 2.0? in 2005, I really tried to get across the idea that collective intelligence and data driven applications were the key to the future, but it's only now that it's become widely understood.When +Edd Dumbill and +Alistair Croll proposed the Strata conference to me, it seemed so clear that now, finally, it was time to get off the soapbox, and to put together an event that was practical, and would help developers and executives make sense of how to build cloud data applications.As Alistair says in this post, \"Big data: use it or lose it.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "This oldie-but-goodie is worth reading. Duncan Watts explains the research that shows the randomness of music hits. His team divided an online population of visitors to a music site into eight segments, and gave each segment feedback on how many times each song was downloaded.  If there was an intrinsic \"worthiness\" driving song popularity, you'd expect each song to get about the same proportion in each segment. But instead entirely different songs became hits in each segment, indicating that once you're above a certain level of quality, it's the feedback effects that drive popularity.\"The reason is that when people tend to like what other people like, differences in popularity are subject to what is called \u201ccumulative advantage,\u201d or the \u201crich get richer\u201d effect. This means that if one object happens to be slightly more popular than another at just the right point, it will tend to become more popular still. As a result, even tiny, random fluctuations can blow up, generating potentially enormous long-run differences among even indistinguishable competitors \u2014 a phenomenon that is similar in some ways to the famous \u201cbutterfly effect\u201d from chaos theory.\"Via Nathan Torkington (@gnat)\ufeff",

Maybe that will also cause hospitals to be more willing to report their data so they can be named to the \u201cHonor Roll.\u201d As it is, you are better off keeping things opaque to protect your reputation.\"\"I think it is time to acknowledge that this ranking offers very little in the way of valuable information.  It is mainly a vehicle for advertisements from the pharmaceutical industry, who know that this issue of the magazine gets a lot of attention and high circulation.  As you flip through to each specialty, you are blasted with ads for drugs related to syndromes within that specialty.\"It seems to me that if we're going to reform healthcare, we need more of what Paul is preaching.\ufeff",

Watching my grandson, I see how conscious he is of things he's learning, that I now take for granted. Yet we also lose something by becoming unconscious, by doing things without thinking.What does need to become automatic?  (Examples that occur to me are many kinds of government regulation, things that need to become autonomic rather than by paper fiat.)  What needs to rise to awareness again? The goals behind various things that we once learned that are no longer appropriate.Would love your thoughts.\ufeff",

I was headed through the Sierra, and was caught by the fact that Google noted that passes \"may be closed\" (rather than \"are closed\"). I couldn't believe that they actually were, since it was 90 degrees out, even fairly high up into the mountains.But the real point of my post wasn't that Google could do a better job in these edge cases (though they could, especially if CalTrans published a data feed of when they open and close the gates - that would be a simple instance of what I've called \"Government as a Platform\"), but rather, the experience of depending on digital maps, and finding them lacking. Meanwhile, print maps were nowhere to be found.It strikes me that there are a lot of hidden vulnerabilities in our increasing dependence on the augmented senses that we take for granted in our smart phones. It's worthwhile to get beyond cell range once in a while, and see what you've forgotten.At the end of the point, I ask what else is fragile, and might bite us someday. I'd love your thoughts.\ufeff",

But as a content consumer, it's really hard to peruse.andEvery threaded Google+ post has 10 clickable action calls not even counting the content, avatars, and handles. Facebook 6. Twitter 5.I think he's right that it's too complex. Twitter has the advantage that it started ultra-simple and grew complexity (thinking of John Gall: \"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.\")That being said, I don't think Google+ is over the line of complexity. I think it's close enough to right that some tweaks will make it easier to use and consume.I do think that the fact that you can't have threaded discussions on Twitter is a feature, an important one. The fact that Google+ lets you write posts like this makes it intrinsically harder to use.  But hey, Facebook shows us that that isn't over the complexity barrier for people. I think it's going to work. The main thing I want is tighter integration of other services.  I want to be able to email stuff into G+, a la posterous. I want to be able to \"retweet.\"  I want to be able to gateway my tweets and expand on them (that would be killer for me, if I could just automatically send over a tweet, then write a bit more commentary and backstory.)  So those are new features, to be added.\ufeff",
